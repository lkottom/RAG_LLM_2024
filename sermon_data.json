    "The Mortals Walking with the Almighty?": {
        "content": "Enoch faithfully walked with God and pleased Him such that Enoch was even spared from death . To walk with God we must deal with our hate for Him. We saw this hate in Adam when he avoided and blamed God for giving him Eve and when Cain killed Abel out of jealousy. Removing such hostility requires the Holy Spirit . Through faith in Christ we are reconciled with God the Father and the Holy Spirit comes to dwell in us. As we remain in fellowship with God we will grow daily and become more like Christ. There are a few things we can do to help us maintain that fellowship. Read and meditate day and night on Gods words so they become a lamp to our feet and light to our path even Christ fought Satan by quoting the Scripture. Meditate on Gods works such as Christs crucifixion. Pray privately and unceasingly no matter how brief. Pay close attention to His work on us and to the Holy Spirits guidance. To avoid being misguided by our emotions or reasoning use Gods word to test what we think might be the Holy Spirits guidance. Also obey His commands and find fellowship with other believers. As iron sharpens iron so too do believers spurring each other toward love and good deeds . It is a great honor to walk with God with the Lord of lords in us and to be called His friend . This is a pleasant path because ways of wisdom are pleasant ways . His words are sweeter than honey. With the love of the Holy Spirit in us we will be filled with joy even in tribulation. The apostles rejoiced after being flogged and Paul sang hymns in prison after being stripped and severely beaten . Furthermore our rewards and blessings in the new heaven and earth will be great with everlasting glory from God waiting for us. So Christians dont be lukewarm. Remember the joy of walking with God and let the love of Christ drive you to walk with Him.",

    "Old Testament People Living for What?": {
        "content": "After the flood sin was still rampant. Then came Abraham. God showed Abraham He would justify all nations by faith with all nations blessed through Abraham . Gods desire is to bring blessings to all nations. Abraham was chosen for this purpose as was Israel. Not because Israel was good but because of His love God chose Israel to be His witness by which He would bring salvation to all . Then through Christ salvation came to all nations as promised in the Old Testament . So the mission of Gods people in the OT was to bring Gods blessing of salvation to all nations. To achieve such a mission required Biblical ways of living. Abraham and his people needed to live distinctively following Gods righteousness and not Sodoms way of injustice cruelty and wantonness . Similarly Israelites were to live following Gods teachings . If so they would be Gods priests and a holy nation bringing God to all nations and drawing them to God. That was the purpose of the OT laws which were ultimately fulfilled through Christ. Gods people must follow Gods ways to bear witness to and bring the knowledge of God to all. Gods people are to shine before them attracting them to God . Examples of witnessing in the OT include Joshua terrifying the surrounding nations and attracting people like Rahab to God and the Israelites themselves being sent into exile before their subsequent return . Through such witnessing ultimately the nations will benefit and praise God. Those who choose to be Gods people will be accepted into an allnation community that knows worships and loves God . Gods creation will rejoice together in the coming of the Lord culminating in the new heaven and the new earth . In the New Testament Christians are to live following Gods teachings and obey the Great Commission. Christians are to bring Gods blessings to all and make God known to the ends of the earth. Thus the mission of Gods people is deeply rooted in the OT. A",

    "Christianity According to Paul": {
        "content": "Paul ventured beyond Jerusalem to convert nonbelievers to Christ. To the Gentiles Paul was crazy because Christ was crucified. To the Jews treating Christ as their Messiah was scandalous. Paul forced both groups to ask themselves who God was what His purpose was and what that meant for them. Those who accepted his message became renewed creations with new eyes and new minds growing and maturing in their new knowledge of the Creator. No longer enslaved by foolish things they saw the importance of love. Their new lives centered on Christ. These transformed individuals formed a united and holy community focused on God not on earthly things. Through this community people would see Christ as Lord. Paul rooted the above in the Old Testament. Regarding the concept of only one God as shown in Shema the Jewish daily prayer Hear O Israel the Lord is our God the Lord is one Paul refreshed this concept into one God the Father and one Lord Christ . Just as Christ humbled Himself despite being God we should also humble ourselves in our relationships with others. In light of this God the Father shares His glory with Christ compare this to the Jewish concept of God never sharing His glory. Regarding being Gods people Jews in Exodus were freed from Egyptian slavery with God living among them just as we slaves of sins become Gods children through Christ with the Holy Spirit living in us. But Paul placed knowing Christ above all his Jewish privileges. Instead of Jews alone being Gods people Jews and Gentiles alike are justified through Christ as one people under God. As to our future it is analogous to how the Israelites left Egypt and inherited the promised land. Through Christ we become part of the new heaven and earth. Paul teaches us to live according to the Spirit with our minds set on what the Spirit desires. But we still live in a fallen world. Fortunately in our weakness we can rely on the Spirit who helps us and intercedes for us before the Father.What we do in Christ wont be in vain but instead will be part of Gods new creation. So let us give ourselves fully to the work of the Lord.",

        "content": "Lets explain a few concepts regarding the end times. Some people focus too much on the millennium a term that appears only in one passage in Revelation which is a book filled with symbolic imagery. Others focus on the rapture and Christians being snatched away. Instead our focus should be on Christs return. Furthermore the New Testament has nothing on the Israel state. The Old Testaments promises to the Israelites are fulfilled in Christ not through any holy land. Gentiles and Jews share the same inheritance in Christ. In the end times Christ will return personally. All will see His glorious return and the dead will be raised. Christ will be the fair and merciful judge. His judgments will last forever with all wrongs exposed and all wickedness destroyed. His judgments will be based on what we know and our situations according to our deeds and our lives. We are justified through faith and our deeds will show whether we lived in faith. God will transform His creation into the new heaven and earth with no more death mourning pain impurity strife violence war or sin. Many will go to heaven but earth is the final home. God will come down to be with us on earth. We will openly see Gods face. We will live with God in our gloriously resurrected bodies. The corrupted physical creation will be cleansed of its curse. All people and animals will live peacefully together praising and honoring God. The new earth includes the city in Revelation a secure spacious and beautiful place like the garden of Eden but with the tree of life always there for us. People will bring into the city their glorious and honorable splendor filling the city with their cultural richness and we will enjoy the work of our hands there. Until that day we should faithfully do what He has told us to do so well be ready for the end times. Rest in our sovereign God who will redeem us and put all things right again. Also let us thank God for giving us a new birth and a living hope through Christs death and resurrection. Thank God for giving us a real life in His new creation.",

    "The Senselessness of Suffering": {
        "content": "Humans have caused lots of suffering. Genesis describes how the devil tempted humans into rejecting Gods authority distrusting His goodness and disobeying Him which led to the downfall of mankind. The Bible doesnt explain the origin of the devil but describes the devil as an angel rebelled and fought against God such as attacking Christ throughout His ministry. Despite this the devil still exists under Gods authority. God doesn't create evil because there is no darkness in God. Though we cant make sense of the devil we need to reject and resist him. We also cant make sense of natural disasters and catastrophic pandemics which cause suffering as well. The curse on the ground in Genesis didnt cause them because that curse was on humans. The story of Job teaches us that suffering is not necessarily a punishment from God. Natural disasters have existed all along. If God used disasters to punish He wouldve stated so. Many in the Bible including Job Jeremiah and numerous psalmists lamented and questioned their loving and allpowerful God. They complained furiously protesting to Gods slowness in responding. Yet they still believed in Gods sovereignty and goodness. We also need to trust God being in charge. We need to believe that all things work together for His purpose as seen in the life of Joseph. Similarly we need to trust Gods goodness. The cross demonstrates His goodness as well as the wickedness of Satan and men under their free will. But Gods sovereignty weaves all these together for our good. Finally Revelation teaches that God is at the center of the universe with all creation around Him. Only Christ can understand human history not us. And Gods sovereignty overrides all evilness with God judging the wicked and saving His people. In the end Christ will rule over everything with all evil death pain shame deceit impurity and curse eradicated. In His sovereignty God weaves evil into His purpose to redeem the whole of creation accomplishing the greatest good. This is our wonderful hope in which we have total confidence and incomparable joy.",

    "The Hidden Tapestry God Weaves": {
        "content": "Sometimes our invisible God seems powerless or apathetic in our daytoday life. And we dont even know how to pray about it . starts with we know. We know God is in control of all aspects of our life to manifest His glory and bless us. Dont let circumstances control you. Instead learn about God. The more we know Him the better prepared we are to deal with our confusing world. God promises that all things work together according to His plan. He is always working behind the scenes to fulfill this plan. In everything God works for good. In the short term things can look terrible. But life events are synergistic. God weaves them together for good. This promise is to those who love Him . They are also those called by God. These are two sides of a coin one side from us loving God and the other side from God calling us to Himself for His purposes. Lets look at a few heroes in the Bible. Job suffered terribly. He lost everything. Even his friends said he deserved it. Though Job didnt understand why he trusted Gods sovereignty and stood strong during all his lifes disasters . Joseph was sold to Egypt and suffered for years. But he followed God. Later as the second most powerful man in Egypt he succinctly said everything was woven together under Gods plan for good . Jeremiah told the Jewish people in exile and destruction that weaving everything together God had a plan to give them hope and a future . Finally look at Christ. God the Father turned all Satans evil plots against Christ into humanitys greatest blessing . So trust God. Believe that all things are under His control . If we walk with God every day there is nothing to fear. All things work together for their good of those who love God. So count your blessings in gratitude. And live grittily. Hold fast to your goals. If you fall get back up and fight again. Serve God in faith and without fear because He is our safety net.",

    "You Can Never Understand the Cross": {
        "content": "In His great love God sacrificed Himself on the cross pouring His blood in place of ours . But why? Why does God love us? Can we ever understand? God loves the Israelites not because they are important or righteous or even because He is their God . He loves them for reasons only known to Him. Similarly only God knows why He loves us and has mercy on us . So just be amazed and thankful . The cross has phenomenal effects. Through it God has forgiven us freeing us from sins control justified us before Him reconciled with us enabled us to reconcile with others and has given us new life . His crucifixion has removed our guilt before God and bears our shame of covering up our real self removing our shame before others . How the cross achieves this is a mystery. We cant fully understand why the Father working with the Son ferociously assaulted and killed His beloved Son to appease His own standard of justice. One reason may be that God hates evil. The Father handed Christ to the wicked to be tortured and killed. The Father also separated Christ from Him. The New Testament said the cross was in accordance with the Scriptures . Christ also linked His death to Solomon temples destruction drawing a parallel between crucifixion and Israelites history. Because of their rebellion God handed the Israelites to wicked people. They were exiled and nearly annihilated with the temple destroyed. God separated Himself from Israel . Yet while the Israelites were sinful Christ was innocent. Similarly because of our rebellion God has separated Himself from us and handed us to the wicked. And we suffer from them. Though we can argue that God doesnt want to turn us into puppets do we deserve to be punished when it was God who made the moral universe? Can we exonerate God from all involvements? We cant fully comprehend Gods sovereignty and our responsibility. But what we can see is Gods love on Calvary. We can see Christ being cut off from the Father and bearing Gods judgment of our sin so we can reconcile with God . A",

It brings us the living hope of an inheritance that is eternal unlike earthly things that is pure with no evil suffering and sin and that is as beautiful as Christs neverfading glorious body . But our journey on earth is one of sanctification. We will fall but in that failure we should pray fervently and rely on Gods grace. Through the power of God we can stand up from where we fall and hold firmly onto our conviction to do Gods will . We shouldnt rely on what we see. Our trust shouldnt be in our wealth and health. Instead focus on Gods glory Gods will and His Kingdom. Trust God to be our Lord. His glory is the hope of humanity . During this journey we will experience suffering and trial. This is partially because living a godly life brings persecution . In suffering persist in your faith which is purified by the trial. When Christ returns those holding onto their faith will receive praise from Him and crowns as good as Pauls . We will be like Christ and with Christ who is on the throne . This salvation doesnt just promise us wonderful blessings in the future. On earth today it already provides us an abundant life through Gods great blessings. We can enjoy a loving relationship with the invisible Christ. Though we may have to suffer grief in all kinds of trials the Holy Spirit can bring us Gods grace and guidance and help us trust His wonderful plan.

    "How to Thrive in Our Suffering?": {
        "content": "Since the apostle Peters time Christians have suffered at the hands of nonbelievers. How should we face it ? First we accept suffering decay and death as inevitable and we persevere . Sometimes the end of suffering comes slowly. The world focuses on efficiency and instant gratification. But as in Walter Mischels marshmallow experiment fiveyearold kids who could resist eating marshmallows for fifteen minutes typically were more successful later in life than those who couldnt. Dont let food sex or other idols control you but practice selfcontrol . Suffering can come from those around us specifically when we choose not to indulge in the same excesses of dissipation. Persevere as Christ has persevered . Second trust and depend on God. Wait for Him in faith . God didnt cause your suffering but He knows and has His plans. Have faith and follow Him . Jesus is the author and perfector of faith sitting at the right hand of the Father . He was also human having been through tremendous suffering. We should pray unceasingly to Him and trust His affirmations that everything will be fine and we should trust His tears assuring that He cares for us and wont forget us. Third focus on the upcoming rewards. This will help us endure suffering. Our pain on earth is temporal but our future glory will be eternal . Dont envy the wicked for judgment waits for them. In Mischels experiment children practiced better selfcontrol when they found distractions such as running around singing and looking at things other than the enticing marshmallows. Christ experienced tremendous suffering. But He persevered focusing on following the Fathers will and the destiny He was given . Likewise we should turn our eyes upon Christ and arm ourselves with His purpose to endure suffering. Dont be afraid of it. Also we should love one another fervently use our gifts to serve each other as good stewards of Gods grace and be hospitable to one another without grumbling. This includes accepting care from others. Bear our burdens together. In all things glorify God through Christ .",

He influences and enables us to do right to be wise and speak the word of God as shown in Davids Psalms Solomons words of wisdom and the fire touching Isaiahs lips. He generated the hands in the Book of Daniel. He calls people to do certain work such as telling Peter to go to the centurion . He took Philip away . He gave Spurgeon power to preach. He convinces us of our sins and gives us life when we are dead in sins . The Holy Spirit lives in us forever with us becoming Gods temple . Though we cant see the Holy Spirit we feel His presence and experience His power. But those not selected by God dont know havent experienced and reject the Holy Spirit . The Holy Spirit deeply cares about us. We are made in the image of the Holy Trinity or in Their image . The Holy Trinity loves us and works together for our salvation. The Son intercedes for us the Father listens and sends the Holy Spirit and the Holy Spirit teaches us the truth and comforts and helps us . So Christians pray seriously to the Holy Spirit.

    "Well, Well, Well, If It Isnt the Consequences of My Own Actions": {
        "content": "Mistakes have consequences and sometimes those consequences bring pain and suffering that last for a long time. When that happens what should we do? How should we react? Lets learn from the book of Zephaniah. In the twelve minor prophet books the prophets didnt always explain things chronologically but instead went from topic to topic. Most of the books start with Gods judgment and end with Gods mercy and love. Zephaniah follows this pattern its first two chapters focus on judgment and punishment with the third on mercy and love. The Israelites disobeyed God ignored His corrections and ran away from Him. They depended on wealth army political alliance and worshipping false gods. Their officials were fierce and cruel. Their religious leaders distorted the law for their own benefit. And so they were punished. Chapter starts with judgment and punishment . The prophet Zephaniah predicted that Gods wrath would come and didnt sugarcoat the severity of the pains and sufferings . The prophet also predicted the day of salvation . Zephaniah told them to fear God accept correction and actively wait for salvation from the Lord. If they did so their lips would be purified . This purification extended to their actions and hearts . In other words they would be internally and externally consistent with their hearts and actions reflecting their pure lips. In His love God would no longer rebuke them but would rejoice over them . This was the mercy that would come after punishment. Zephaniah tightly coupled future salvation to current punishment. This faith and hope helped the Israelites endure and actively wait for their deliverance. Deuteronomy describes both blessing and curse. One main purpose of Gods curse and punishment is to bring us back from our mistakes they are for our good. When we suffer because of our mistakes we must accept His correction and repent. Hold onto and patiently wait for His promise. Have faith that one day Gods love will return and He will not recount our sins. Instead He will greatly rejoice over us.",

Creation is groaning . Fortunately we are integrated with Christ and have the Holy Spirit dwelling in us. We are heavens citizens following heavens ways. This is like Roman citizens living outside of Rome but following Romes ways. Dont despair. Instead we should share Christs suffering and carry our cross . Our hope is in things we dont see.

        "content": "Lets learn from Gods promise and examples after examples of God fulfilling them in Chronicles. In Chapter Solomon prayed to God about His promise in Deuteronomy . God responded affirming that rebellion led to curses but that forgiveness would come if they humbled themselves prayed and sought Gods face and turned from wickedness . Humility means to accept ourselves as Gods creation. Praying to God is an act of humility. We dont pray if we think we can handle everything. Seeking Gods face means following Gods commands where seeking with all your heart being similar to loving God with all your heart in Deuteronomy . In the bible to love God isnt just a feeling but a commitment to follow His command as an expression of that love . Solomons prayer concludes with Gods promised love . Chronicles repeats the refrain He is good his love endures forever a reminder that God will always keep His promise specifically the promise in . is on admitting sin repenting and receiving forgiveness like salvation through faith . In the Old Testament prayers went through the temple. Later John identified Christ as the temple which Christ rebuilt in three days. So prayers now go through Christ not Solomons temple. Chapters describe the rise and fall of the several kings illustrating the promise of verse in action. A common pattern repeats itself a king would seek God and be blessed but then grow arrogant and abandon God leading to his downfall. But repentance brings salvation. Lets look at the following examples in Chronicles Rehoboams humility leads to God saving him from total annihilation Asa depends entirely on his own strength ignoring God leading to his death Jehoshaphats alliance with a bad king leads to an attack but the promise in leads to God destroying the enemies Joash fails after following his officials instead of God Amaziah seeks God but after defeating the Edomites seeks the Edomite gods also which leads to his downfall Uzziahs success makes him arrogant causing leprosy and Manasseh recovers after repenting .

        "content": "Many imagine heaven filled with things they love such as wonderful entertainment gourmet food and vibrant health. But the Bible teaches otherwise. In Revelations new heaven and earth the holy place God lives with His people as He did in the Garden of Eden. Both Eden and the new heaven and earth have rivers and trees. The New Testament represents Christ as living water continually quenching our thirst and a true vine. We must be grafted to Him to bear fruit. He is the temple the holy place. Through Christ God lives with us. Furthermore Gods glory brightens the new heaven and earth. It is a place of purity like clearascrystal jewel and pureastransparentglass gold. Humans there are sinless purified by Christs blood. The key activity in the holy place is to worship God. Today we tend to revere the rich and the famous. Caesar once had a powerful empire yet Christians worshipped the invisible Christ as Lord not Caesar. Earthly things are transient and cant fulfill our real needs. Today we see good people suffer and evil people prosper. Yet Christians should trust our sovereign God and His longterm plan to reward the good and punish the wicked. To Christians the real reality should be the invisible Lord who created and rules over all things. And we should worship Him. So until that new heaven and earth are established how should Christians live now? Our Holy God requires us to lead a pure life through Christ. Among sins one of the worst is lying. John described Satan as the father of lies. Liars actions and words dont match. They may call God their Lord and friend while walking in darkness. Have we lied?

        "content": "The following addresses some questions in Christianity. Many Old Testament requirements were specifically for the Israelites at a specific time and Christians are not required to observe them today. But Christs new commands of loving God and our neighbors are for all nations . Christians still keep OT requirements that are also under Christs new rules such as refraining from adultery and murder. Tithing was an OT requirement tied to the Tabernacle and priests . Christ discussed tithing because the Jews at the time were still under the old covenant . Though Christians dont have to tithe giving sacrificially and generously will increase our joy . Speaking in tongues is a gift of speaking in different languages . Some incorrectly equate speaking in tongues to baptism of the Spirit all are baptized by the Spirit at conversion but only some can speak in tongues . Speaking in tongues occurred in the Bible for specific purposes such as demonstrating Gentiles being saved and salvation not via Johns baptism of repentance . Love is more important even than speaking in the tongues of angels let alone tongues of men . The in Revelation and symbolize all believers not the Jews because they can withstand Gods wrath in Revelation they are the redeemed hearing Judahs lion and seeing the lamb are similar to hearing the but seeing uncountable multitudes the number x is symbolic in nature Jews can be under Satan and Gentiles can be Abrahams children the twelve tribes lack the tribe of Dan and most Jews dont know their originating tribes so literally fulfilling the prophecy is probably meaningless.",

        "content": "The Bible teaches us to be thankful and joyful . But how about Lamentations sorrow and criticizing and accusing God? As explained in Deuteronomy if the Israelites obeyed God blessings would pour on them if not cursing would come in five incremental phases the longer they spurned Gods laws. The fourth phase included plagues enemies attack and hunger. And the final was being scattered among nations . Lamentations author the prophet Jeremiah described Gods violence towards them setting traps for them putting them in the hands of their enemies abandoning warriors and crushing the young. Though suffering has other causes Jeremiah accepted their disobedience as the logical cause of their pain and sorrow. He never disputed the reasons behind their suffering. Yet Jeremiah complained and accused God furiously questioning why the suffering was so intense why there was such severe hostility now when God was so close before why He punished them for their ancestors sins and why He didnt punish others . With enemies invading them and other nations totally ignoring them Jeremiah kept asking God to witness their suffering and pain . He fervently cried out to God probably because he believed Gods promise on removing the curse if they humbled themselves confessed their sins and repented . And Jeremiah lamented. There are two types of laments. The first type is shown in David mourning the death of Saul as a hero . It is typically used at a funeral and is filled with despair. Lamentation describes the second type. It cries out to God not to yourself or any other person. It accepts your own fault and honestly expresses your intense frustration even blaming and accusing God for ignoring you and your pain and suffering. But it never gives up on God. You hold tightly onto Him. You keep asking Him to witness your miserable conditions. You trust that He will understand your criticism and feel your pain. Such lament helps you endure and face pain and suffering and its a form of faith. You honestly passionately and forcefully cry out to God with the hope and belief that He will rescue you. Ultimately its a form of prayer and worship and it is good and holy.",

The cross pays for them removes their burden on us and allows us to reconcile with God. Though our past is dead via the cross sins and our past still influence us. We still feel the pain and their consequences but they cant control us . Through the cross we become a new person with Christ living in us . Christs perfect life replaces our corrupted ones. Third Christ humbled Himself to the point of death in obedience to the Father. Christ didnt come only to die or He wouldnt have needed to evade His enemies for a time. Christ came to do the will of the Father. As the angels proclaimed by lowering Himself Christ glorified the Father . Christ was the only person who perfectly followed the Fathers will. Christ exemplified obedience in His suffering . Learn from Christs example. Via the Holy Spirit let Christs life grow in us and let God take over. Satan holds the power of death but Christ broke Satans power through the cross freeing us from the slavery of the fear of death . God has guaranteed that though we will die our bodies will resurrect and become incorruptible just like Christs resurrection. Christs resurrection was supported by the drastic transformation of many witnesses and is supported by our personal changes. Christs resurrection marked the end of the old world and the coming of the new . We can start our everlasting life now by knowing the Father and Christ . We can know God by loving and serving Him. We will face challenges but we can overcome them by trusting God and looking back at how God has helped us before. Then we will experience His power and grace.

        "content": "Jesus was a friend to sinners including tax collectors a Samaritan woman with five failed marriages and a criminal on a cross. But the church nowadays is increasingly seen as the moral police where sinners dont feel loved. We should focus on our own moral purity but reach out to others caring for the oppressed and devoting ourselves to the sick and the poor. Christ was a Galilean man with a family but declared Himself as God. He said I forgive your sins I am sending you prophets I and the Father are one anyone who has seen me has seen the Father I am the way the truth and the life no one comes to the Father except through me and before Abraham was born I am. Belonging to a monotheistic people the disciples might have been startled and even offended by Christs supposed arrogance. For three years they couldnt understand Him. But weeks after His crucifixion they worshipped Him as God through whom all things were made. Did God personally experience the cross? If not Christs crucifixion could be seen as cosmic child abuse. Like the disciples we need to decide if He is the Son of God a madman or something worse. Jesus reveals the image of the invisible God. Through Him we see God more clearly. In the Old Testament God is seen as omnipotent distant and terrifying. But Christ demonstrated Gods loving and serving nature. Now in view of the price Christ paid we can call on God as Abba the loving Father. Jesus reveals a compassionate God searching for us a God desperate to get His family back. God wants us to love Him. This has been illustrated in the parables of the lost sheep the lost coin and the prodigal son. God the Father demonstrated His love by sacrificing His Sons life for us. Some may even consider His approaches reckless . Jesus reveals what we created as the image of God were meant to be and how far we have missed the mark. Jesus shows God enduring weakness insults hardships and persecution to defeat sin overcome death triumph over Satan and get His family back. We are healed by His wounds not His miracles.",

Instead of using this opportunity to build an earthly empire Jesus told them not to work for food that spoiled but for spiritual food that endured to eternal life and that He was the bread of life for them to eat. Troubled by such teachings most left. Then Christ asked the twelve disciples if they wanted to leave too. Peter responded Christ had the words of eternal life and was the one from God. Then Christ said one of the twelve was a devil referring to Judas . Though Peter didnt fully understand he trusted Christ while Judas did not. Perhaps Judas wanted Christ to defeat the Romans but felt disillusioned when many left. Many today follow Christ with the hope of attaining worldly things such as wealth power fame and health. One day when they dont get what they want will they leave Christ or accept Gods sovereignty? When Mary anointed Jesus feet with expensive perfume Judas again focused on worldly value even though Jesus had just raised Lazarus from the dead. Judas complained that the money from the perfume could be given to the poor even though he hypocritically had been stealing from the money bag. To Mary Gods grace eclipsed all material things . Initially Judas probably worshipped Christ but when Judas became convinced that Christ wouldnt help him reach his goal he decided that Christ wasnt useful to him . Christ warned Judas at least twice. First Christ indirectly said Judas was unclean when Christ was washing the feet of the disciples. Second Christ told Judas pointblank he would betray Him . But Judas ignored Christs warnings Christ wasnt important to him anymore. Christ traveled with no set routes and constantly there were many people around Him. Judas betrayed Christ by telling the Jewish leaders where and when to find Christ. When Judas identified Christ by kissing Him Christ didnt scold Judas but rather asked if he was betraying Him with a kiss . What can we learn from Judas?",

        "content": "Christ ascended into heaven after imparting His work to His followers including healing gracious blessing and spreading the good news of Gods love. He sent them as the Father had sent Him . But these people were filled with flaws constantly forgetting their missions and making unwise choices. Such trust could bring grief instead of delight to God. Three parables in Matthew describe the departed Christ An absentee landlord putting his servant in charge a bridegroom arriving so late that the guests fall asleep and a master distributing money among his servants before leaving . The next parable of sheep and goats warns that one day the departed Lord will return to settle accounts. But before He returns He turned things over to us. He knew the hungry lonely ragged sick and imprisoned are with us in fact He disguised Himself as such. Christ told us that in serving them in love we serve God. And when Christ comes back in His glory He will bless those who served and punish those who ignored the needy . Unfortunately the church is filled with racism intolerance and petty legalism. Numerous Christian events conform to the pattern of a fallen world such as the Crusades the Inquisition Christian slave trades and apartheid. But the church also has brought light to the world through people like St. Francis Mother Teresas Home for the Dying Wilberforces abolitionism and General Booths Salvation Army. Jesus chose His recruits and appointed them to the tasks . On such weak structures He built His church over which even hell wouldnt prevail. Though His followers keep disappointing Him He loves them to the end and promises them the kingdom of heaven . We need to remember that our deadly prideful nature takes time to change particularly because we resist such change. We cant instantly return to the original state God created us. Instead of miraculously intervening in human affairs Christ chooses to bear the wounds of the church. But if we are willing God will continue to help us get up from our constant failures so we become more and more like Him .",

Peacemakers resolve conflicts not by avoiding conflict or appeasing others . Reconciliation takes precedence even over worship . But how do we reconcile? First make the first move. Peacemakers make peace. Reconcile quickly because conflict cant resolve itself and putting it off worsens it. We are afraid of rejection and being misunderstood so we often avoid confrontation and hide making us distant demanding and defensive. Ask God for love because love can overcome our fear . Second ask God for wisdom . He will teach us what to say and when to say it. Third begin with your fault. Conflict typically comes from our desires battling within us and from pride which leads to argument . But we can choose to get along to learn and to be flexible. Be humble . We need others to identify our blind spots. Just say I am sorry I am only thinking of myself. Fourth seek to understand their hurt and perspective. Argument typically happens when someone was abused or humiliated. Listen particularly to the emotion behind the words. See their perspective. Be considerate particularly of their fears and doubts . Fifth speak the truth tactfully with love . It is not what you say but how you say it. Being abrasive isnt persuasive. Dont say things designed to hurt belittle or insult . Usually it is rude to tell it just as it is. Instead speak the truth lovingly. Use helpful not harmful words . Speak wisely not recklessly . Sixth attack the issues and problems not each other. Seventh focus on reconciliation and accept disagreements not requiring seeing eyetoeye. God has forgiven our sins and restored our relationship with Him. Now bring people together . Be peacemakers.",

Assume we have been terribly wronged and we are angry. Before addressing the issue of forgiveness lets look at anger. Anger intrinsically is good. Like other emotions they are created by God. Numerous places in the Old Testament describe God in anger. When someone misused Sabbath to cause intense suffering and torture Christ was angry . So dont suppress or deny our anger . Though we should not suppress our anger we should control it and express it within boundaries. We also should not let anger linger on but rather gradually get rid of it together with our bitterness and brawling. Otherwise the devil could use anger as a beachhead to get to us . Lets get back to forgiveness. Why should we forgive? Christians forgive not because it is the moral things to do but because in Christ God forgave us allowing us to be His children . Since God has forgiven our huge debt we should forgive others small debts . Christians forgive because our Father in heaven has forgiven us. Sometimes we dont forgive others because we think we are better and would never commit such mistakes. Sometimes we wont even forgive ourselves because we think our mistakes are too big to deal with. In both cases we focus on ourselves. Instead we should focus on Christ. Let Christs sacrifice for us melt our stubborn heart. Have mercy on others because God has been merciful to us . By the way it may take us awhile to learn to forgive others. Changing takes time. Be patient. In conclusion we should channel our anger energy to attack and solve problems and hold no ill will. Instead we must forgive others because our heavenly Father has forgiven us allowing us to be His beloved children.",

    "BaptismThe Story of the Cross": {
        "content": "Baptism is when Christians publicly express following and putting their trust in Christ. We receive His forgiveness healing and strength. Paul compared baptism to the Israelites crossing the Red Sea which is the central narrative of Israelites history. After God led them out of Egypt the Israelites encamped next to the Red Sea. Right there they saw Pharaoh with his Egyptian armies marching after them and were terrified. But Moses told them to have no fear stand firm and be still for God would fight for them. Then God told them to go into the Red Sea . This personal experience of God transformed their livesfrom the cruel oppressive and genocidal slavery to freedom from mortal danger to safety from terrified to dancing and singing and from living like others in the ancient world to following Gods commandments. Similarly through baptism we would die with Christ and resurrect with Him in victory to live a new life . This experience of Gods love and forgiveness transformed usfrom the slavery of pride social status and guilt to freedom from living in fear and the danger of total destruction in hell to safety and joy in God and from worldly living to following Christs enlightened path. With grace from God we live our new life and we have a new hope. We would see God fighting for us so we have no fear. We could stand firm and be still. As children of God our life gets turned around this process could be sudden or it could be a long journey. Because of Gods love for us we love others. We help those in need. We march for the marginalized. We proclaim the gospel in words and deeds. This is Baptism the story of the cross.",

    "Does the Cross Show a Very Weak Christ?": {
        "content": "Founders of many major religions were often very successful by the time of their deaths. When Moses died millions of Israelites were about to enter the promised land. When Buddha died he had achieved enlightenment with numerous disciples. When Mohammed died he had converted most in the Arabian peninsular to Islam. But Christ died on the cross in an absolutely repugnant way. On the cross He was abandoned practically by everyone. Yet the cross is the symbol of Christianity. Why? Right before His death Christ had a special Passover dinner with His disciples . Passover dinners commemorated God liberating the Israelites from Egypt. The festival referred to a particular night when many firstborns were killed but families with the blood of a lamb on doors were spared. So the Passover dinner ate a lamb to remember the event. But Christs Passover dinner had no lamb because Christ was the lamb. Through the blood of Christ on the cross we are saved liberated from sin and death. If someone has harmed us typically we either seek revenge on the wrongdoer or we accept it leading to inner struggle and pain. We have harmed God. How did He react? He accepted our mistakes and went through the pain of the cross. Through the cross a Christian community has been built. Israelites typically celebrated Passover with their families but the disciples celebrated it with Christ. They were not bonded by family relationship but by the common experience of the cross. In many communities the powerful support many and expect their loyalty in return. Many serve the rich for special treatment. The community of the cross is different. This community was not based on mutual benefits. On the contrary those in power serve but not for any payoffs from those they serve. As Christ have loved them so they must love one another . Leaders in this community are far from perfect. Peter was shown as a selfish coward with no integrity. Yet after repentance he became the leader. Meditate on the cross. The cross shows Gods earnest desire for us. Through the cross we are liberated and accepted by God. Though weak we can still serve and love one another because God loves us first. That may be why the Cross is the symbol of Christianity.",

They were together every day devoting themselves to learning from the apostles about the Lords supper prayer and fellowship. In their daily fellowship they were committed to meet and eat together with glad and sincere hearts . Such togetherness helped them see God in each others life. Such fellowship implied sharing their life with honesty and sincerity walking in the light and openly sharing who they weretheir weaknesses strengths ugliness and beauty. No hiding no pretending . In their fellowship they rejoiced in each others happiness bore each others burden and shared what they had. They did not focus on prolonging and enriching their own life because they knew they could lose all these things the next day. They were not condescending and did not separate themselves based on social status. Instead early Christians sold their possessions to give to anyone who had needs . They should have lots of conflict and internal turmoil because they were a diverse group of people from many cultures and classes including Jews Gentiles slaves free rich poor educated uneducated social antisocial male and female. But instead they took off their masks speaking the truth and praying honestly together. Such diversity and honesty did not kill their fellowship. This may be because they shared the attribute of being saved by Christ from the path of destruction. Their hearts were filled with joy generosity and gratitude. Together they worshipped and praised God and enjoyed the favor of the people outside their community. And every day the Lord added to them more people who were saved. Wouldnt it be great to have such a community? Let us commit to developing such joyful fellowship to learn about God and pray to Him. A sincere and sharing community that worship and praise God together. This will give us more meaning joy and love than we will ever know if we just live in the safety of spiritual isolation.",

The group might make us feel good or more secure about ourselves but this implies exclusivity treating those outside as inferior. Christians dont need to yearn to be included in earthly elite groups. In the days of the Old Testament only the top Priest could be with God for just one day a year. Everyone else was excluded. But because of Christ experiencing the ultimate exclusion when He was forsaken by God the Father we can be included in the family of God and never be forsaken by Him. We can be with God every day! With that we clearly dont need to be included in any worldly elite groups to feel good and secure. Having said that Christians should be with other Christians regularly . Why? A Christian communitys main attribute is not just listening to people explain the Bible but rather gathering in fellowship. It is where Christians help each other grow and support one another particularly in difficult times. Oftentimes we are blind to our biggest flaws but in community Christians can lovingly and honestly confront and even challenge each other so as to spur one another on toward love and good deeds . But the Christian community is not a community that excludes others. The main goals of this group include welcoming and helping outsiders and reaching out and serving even those who despise them. Remember God loves us.

First what should a Christians attitude be? We tend to focus on ourselves and ignore others. But putting our needs pleasures and comfort over others would lead to debilitating conflicts breaking down the community. Focusing on ourselves could be a form of adultery. God hates it. He longs for our undivided love like a husband jealously longing for the love of his wife . Focusing on ourselves is a sign of arrogance particularly if we think we are better. We might attack others fault and avoid them with contempt. God hates arrogance . A humble person focuses less on himself. Christians should be humble and should center on and submit to God. Humility is not a sign of weakness. Moses was extremely humble yet he confronted the powerful Pharaoh and demanded that he gave up his slave labor force unconditionally! Humble Christians have the courage and peace to face evil because they know God is in charge. They could even defeat the powerful devil . If we humble ourselves before the Lord He will lift us up . Christians should focus on Christ. Remember what Christ said. If we focus on saving our life we would lose it but if we focus on Christ and the gospel we will save our life . Learn from Christ. He gave up His place in heaven for us and God the Father glorifies Him making His name above all names. Learn from many parents sacrificing themselves for their children and giving them life. Further the strong should support the weak. Learn to please our neighbors for their good and to build them up . With such attitudes the Christian community is not selfcentered.

Since human relationships inherently have conflict and can be difficult at times when things get rough we might find it more convenient to split. Or it may be because we have been hurt before and dont want to get burned again. So the preference is not to have longterm friendships. However tight relationship is an integral part of Christianity. One reason is because Christians are connected as the body of Christ. During the time of Christ the temple was very important. It was built for God to dwell in and for people to worship Him. Many Israelites believed they would always be safe because God would not let enemies take His temple. Through prophets God told them that this physical object would be destroyed and they would be exiled. In the place of the physical temple is an everlasting building with Christ as the cornerstone. Through Christ Christians are built into the house of God . Christians of the past present and future are all linked together like a body with Christ as the head. Because of Christ there is no need for any intermediary between God and humans. There is no longer a need for priests. Christians could directly pray to God worship Him praise Him and ask for His blessings . Christians can do all these things together.

He was compelled by love to warn them like a mother alerting her child of approaching danger. Have we warned our friends and relatives of impending judgment? As we age there are clear signs of death approaching. If you died now where would you go? To be with Christ in eternal life? Or to everlasting hell without God and hope? Lets examine the reactions of those who witnessed Christ on the cross. Some watched Christ with apathy. Some scoffed at Him challenging Him to save Himself if He was truly the Messiah . But one criminal also being crucified knew he deserved this punishment of crucifixion. And he asked Christ to save him . The criminal might not have known much about Christ. For example he had no idea of Christs resurrection. But he knew he himself deserved to die for his crime and he believed Christ was the solution. So he asked Christ for help. He asked Christ to remember him when Christ came into His kingdom. That was enough for the criminal to be saved Christ told the criminal he would be with Him in paradise on that day . Dont ignore Christ knocking on the door . Learn from the criminal. Know that you deserve Gods punishment recognize Christ as the solution and ask for His help.

When we make mistakes instead of taking responsibility of our fault we complain and blame others. We think we are better. We are arrogant and condescending looking down on others. To go one step further some are even sure of Gods approval. Let us learn from Christs parable on the prayers of a Pharisee and a tax collector . Pharisees were powerful religious leaders who represented the establishment. The tax collector like todays drug dealer or pimp represented the outcast. They both prayed. The Pharisee thanked God he was better than others including the tax collector. He told God he fasted twice a week and gave percent of all he got. Meanwhile the tax collector mourned and would not even look up. He called himself a sinner and asked for Gods mercy. The Pharisee considered himself good even before the eyes of God. In contrast the tax collector knew he had nothing but dirt and he confessed to God. Only the tax collectors prayer was pleasing to God. We need to understand that we bring nothing to God. Everything is by His grace. We also should remember we are sinners. We should admit our mistakes and our weaknesses to God and confess to Him. It is through confessing and repenting that we invite God to come in to heal us. In addition to confessing to God confess to others such as to our friends.

    "The Cure to Burnout": {
        "content": "When Paul prayed for the suffering Christians he asked for a strong spirit or inner self not for God to protect them or reduce their pain . Why? A strong spirit sustains us in adversity. But we are doomed if we have a crushed spirit with no joy or desire to live . What can hurt our spirit? Physical ailments prolonged sickness or not eating right can bring down our spirit. For example thyroid problems can lead to suicidal depression. We can be brought low by a bad conscience causing us to run in fear even with no one chasing us . But a sense of guilt is common. We can be brought low if we have no friends or support. We need kind words to lift us up a shoulder to lean on . But our uniqueness leads to loneliness. We dont even understand ourselves let alone others . We can be brought down if life has no meaning. All parties will end. One member of a happy family will see the death of the rest . We can be brought down if we have no hope . But earthly things are transient. Resting our hope on transient things such as money power traveling fame sex a soulmate or friends leads to emptiness when we lose them or sometimes even when we get them . So how can we strengthen our spirit? The tree of life in Genesis and Revelation represents the fullness of life fulfilling our deepest longing. But when we seek to be in control we lose it. Christ obeyed leading to His spirit and body being crushed on a tree. Through His obedience we gain the tree of life. Through Christ God can love us as we are. We will never be alone because He will always be with us supporting us. Death is not the end but rather a beginning to live in a place that Christ has prepared. So rest your hope and faith in Christ our loving powerful and wise God. He alone can satisfy the deepest longing of our hearts. We still enjoy things on earth. We still need others around us. But our ultimate hope rests in Christ and the Gospel. This will strengthen our spirit allowing us to taste the tree of life.",

    "How to Live in Suffering?": {
        "content": "Psalms is a book of prayers. It has chapters with only Psalms and ending in despair. Why is that? Lets take a look at Psalm . Psalm talks about suffering an inevitable aspect of life. In this Psalm everything seems to go wrong with friends loved ones and life withering away. Feeling totally rejected by God the psalmist criticized and crossexamined God . Such darkness can last for a very long time . The Bible is realistic about the effects of suffering on people. Psalm even ends with the psalmist asking God to turn away so that he might enjoy life again before death. Though the psalmist was mad at God the psalmist still prayed to Him. Psalm was written by Heman who was in charge of music according to Chronicles . Under him Psalms and some in the Psalm s were written. Just as suffering turned Job into someone great darkness may have turned the psalmist into a great artist. Did he ever imagine people thousands of years later still learning from his work? Did God really abandon him? We the selfcentered deserve Gods abandonment. To reconcile with us God paid the greatest price God the Father turned away from Christ so that absolute darkness fell upon Him . Our loving God was willing to go through such pain for us. So even when it seems we are in total darkness we should trust God and know that we are never truly forsaken. Times of darkness may be when we ask ourselves why we follow God. Do we just want earthly things from Him? Thats often how we start with God because we cant see Him. But as time goes by after experiencing His power love and wisdom have our hearts desires changed? Do we still serve ourselves or Him? And lets not forget even though Christ died a terrible death He was resurrected. One day we will be resurrected as well so take comfort that we will never go through anything that resurrection wont fix. To conclude suffering is inevitable and we may not fully understand why. But trust that God always loves us. Suffering may be an opportunity to grow deeper in Him and become more like Christ. Trust that one day we will live in glory with Him.",

    "The Pain of Not Knowing Why We Suffer": {
        "content": "Suffering is inevitable particularly when we get old and sick. Suffering comes in different ways such as parents seeing their beloved kids leaving for colleges. Why do we suffer? Lets learn from the book of Job. Satan accused Job of fearing God because God had given him a lot. Job. In OT fear means an inward awe and wonder. God in control allowed Satan to cause Job to lose all his children servants and animals in one day. Typical responses fall into two camps. Moralistic people believe that if you have lived a good life you will get good stuffs. So suffering is Gods punishment for bad behaviors. Cynical people dont believe in God or believe in God being incompetent/indifferent. To them bad consequences are their own failure. Both responses arise from us intending to take control in life. Suffering has no pat answers. But we know one thing. We will suffer if we live for earthly objects because for sure one day we will lose them. God never explained to Job why he suffered but just asked Job whom he thought He was. God could have told Job that the process had an end with him getting back somewhat to where he was and through it he would become one of the most famous persons on earth with the rest of history learning from him. Instead God put him through the wringer. From the unexplained suffering Job gained a better understanding of God and himself. One of the main challenges of going through sufferings is that we doubt Gods goodness love for us and power. According to Satan there is no love. We are all selfcentered mercenaries manipulators. We are nice to others because we want things from others. We are serving ourselves. When Satan went to Adam and Eve and alleged God didnt really care for them they agreed. We are similar. So we want to be in control and we focus on earthly objects. God shows us there is love and goodness via the cross. Christ has everything. Yet He gave them up was crushed and abandoned. Christs action shows God loves us as who we are proving Satan a liar. When we suffer on earth accept them and accept our ignorance. Trust our mighty God has His plan. Trust in His goodness and His love for us.",

Dont we sometimes feel the same when things are not working out? The Bible has amazing promises but when God doesnt give us what we pray for we feel deserted. Our faith withers particularly if we are facing daunting circumstances. When our temple is destroyed we feel God forgetting us . Responding to Israels despair God didnt say Just suck it up or Poor child. Instead God asked whether a mother would forget her baby at her breast . Tending to Israels emotions and intellect God used the metaphor of a mother and her nursing baby a relationship they could understand. It is difficult for a mother to forget her nursing baby. Physically stopping the nursing is painful because Prolactin pushes the milk out. Emotionally stopping would rob the mother of her delight because bonding with her baby produces oxytocin. Then God added that even mothers might forget but He wouldnt . Such affirming words are powerful. However true love is shown by action. . So God further emphasized His love with the act of engraving Israel on His palms . In Hebrew engraved means using a hammer and chisel. Centuries later addressing Thomas doubt Christ showed him the wounds in His hands . When children dont get what they want they might feel neglected and start to scream. Sometimes we are similar. We should remind ourselves that we dont need many things. Our identity is not based in material possession. We may be experiencing lots of suffering now and God might not answer our prayers with the answer we want. But remember the cross shows that God will never forsake us. On the cross Christ was forsaken taking the punishments we deserve. The cross shows Gods unconditional love. We are engraved in His palms!",

Let us learn how Christs resurrection can drive out fear . Try to understand why Dont be afraid is a command that has showed up times in the Bible. First because of Christs death being buried for three days and resurrection we can trust His words . Second His resurrection shows we also will be raised from the dead . Death is not the end and is not to be feared. So even when we are deteriorating outwardly we must not lose heart nor ever give up. Inwardly we can be renewed day by day . Third His resurrection demonstrates Gods immense love for us. He would rather suffer and die in our place than live without us . This love lasts forever is everywhere can handle all circumstances and covers all our iniquities . We can even lose our minds but nothing can separate us from Gods love . Such love drives out all fear . Fourth through His resurrection He has taken care of our greatest need our salvation. Surely our heavenly Father will take care of all our other smaller needs. Fifth our living God has a plan for us. By His plan our past mistakes are forgiven our lives have purpose and our future home in heaven is guaranteed . In all things God works for the good of those who love Him . Now Christ seating at Fathers right hand is praying for us . If we still worry we act as orphans and we make God look bad .

This promise is also applicable to Christians today. First as Christians we must humble ourselves. Our worst problem is often pride we assume ourselves selfsufficient and fail to recognize our need for God . We should judge ourselves critically lest we come under Gods judgment . Also we should not judge others because we are also sinful . Second we must stop complaining start praying and not give up . Be sincere in our prayer . Be specific with our requests and keep track of Gods answers so that our faith might grow. Third we should seek God earnestly . We spend too much time and effort seeking other things than God when He should be our highest priority and our passion. When we seek Him first everything we need will be given to us . Lastly turn from our mistakes and turn to God completely. We and our culture are loaded down by all sorts of sins . We often see others mistakes as we remain blind to our own . We should repent confess our sins to each other and pray for each other so that we may be healed and refreshed .

The Israelites hated the Samaritans but Christ befriended them. described Christ insisted on going through Samaria though there were other paths. That trip depicted Christ having the longest conversation recorded in the Bible and it was with a Samaritan woman. Later He stayed with the Samaritans for two days . Other examples include Christ healing a Samaritan leper and one of His most memorable parables featured a good Samaritan . Such behaviors irked the Jews to no end causing some to even consider Him a Samaritan . The early church did not separate Jews from Gentiles or the uneducated from the educated . As to genetic differences based on skin color they are in the . percent range. Genetic variations within a race are much higher than variations among different races. In the US slaves were initially Scots Irishman Englishmen and others. Later kidnapping people from Africa as slaves became a big business. One reason was because African slaves were much easier to track down if they ran away. Once here they were isolated oppressed denied equal rights and stripped of numerous opportunities. Those who would discriminate based on skin color are driven by power and greed. It is a way to justify suppression and exploitation. Christ tears down walls and facilitate reconciliation . Christ humbled Himself to become human and die for us . He used His privilege for us. Paul followed Christ and gave up his privilege as a Roman to spread the gospel to Gentiles. We also should follow Christ and use our privilege to help those in need. Fight racism with love. Instead of suppressing those different from us include them and help them if they need it.

        "content": "In claiming absolute truth and adhering to a standard of morality does Christianity pose a threat to freedom? Could Christians live in peace with those they believe to be condemned by God? Are Christians intolerant to atheists or even other Christians of different denominations? Some Christians liken being intolerant to going through the narrow gate to God . But others consider such people as narrowminded irrational bigots. American culture has become increasingly divisive. Many including some evangelical Christians find it difficult even to talk to those with opposing views like Muslims atheists Mormons or LGBTQ persons. Tolerance and accepting absolute truth are not mutually exclusive. Christ claimed absolute truth. He claimed to be the way to eternal life and that no one could come to the Father except through Him . Yet Christ was breathtakingly tolerant. He allowed a prostitute to wash His feet with her hair He commended a hated Roman centurion He partied with despised tax collectors and He healed Samaritan lepers alike . One of the longest conversations recorded in the New Testament was between Christ and a pagan promiscuous female Samaritan . The narrow gate is the path of following Christ. We learn from Him how to live we put Him above all else and we understand His teachings as we obey Him joyfully . Following Christ gives us freedom but real freedom requires restrictions. For fish to live freely they need to be restricted to the water. True freedom requires us to stay within certain boundaries. We are made in Gods image. So we need to follow Christ. Following Christ means being more than tolerant of others. We arent called to merely tolerating them but rather we should love them as ourselves . If we want to be a great violinist or a great football player we need years of discipline and lessons. To be Christs disciples requires no less. This is the narrow gate. Though narrow Christ will be with us on this path. To conclude dont be so sure of ourselves. Be sure of God. Narrowmindedly devote ourselves to Him but broadmindedly accept and love others.",

        "content": "How can people of different races cultures and religions live together in peace? In the Old Testament Jews followed a straight set of dietary laws treating certain foods as unclean. This practice signified cleanliness before God and helped them maintain their identity apart from surrounding cultures. But after Christ our cleansing is through Him. Food is neutral neither clean nor unclean . Even so many early Christians struggled with this change in centuries worth of custom and habits. Early Christians also argued over whether they could eat food blessed by pagan priests. To Paul such worry showed a weakness in their faith . Some consider certain paths to be right. They might despise those outside and consider them as immoral and too liberal with no courage of conviction. They may even resort to violence to force others to follow. Some think that there is no absolute truth. To them all roads lead to Rome. They despise those who claim otherwise and consider them narrowminded intolerant and uncivilized. Racial cultural and religious differences have created lots of conflicts. Different views from diverse groups could help us see the different aspects of God but conflicting views cant all be true. How do we deal with the inherent conflicts? Romans teaches us that we must evaluate to separate right from wrong. But those on the right path should welcome the weak and shouldnt use arguments to change them . Instead we should patiently listen to the other camp and build deep relationships with them gradually encouraging them to listen to our side. Learn from Christ. He condemns our sin but He still stepped down from heaven to build deep relationships with us the sinners. Because of Christ our status before God is not based on our behavior but rather on what Christ has done for us. Because of Christ we know God loves us and our future in the new heaven and earth is assured. Gods assurance has given us hope and the fortitude to change.

Genuine followers of Christ couldnt become terrorists. Christs disciples didnt give in to the surrounding culture nor did they withdraw from it. Holding onto their faith in Christ they engaged with and served their communities. Though recognizing their good deeds their society rejected them . How did the disciples maintain such a balance? First they recognized Christ as their foundation the cornerstone they built their life on . Some people build their foundation on sand whether it be ones intellect physical ability fame or beautysooner or later all of which will fail them. The disciples built themselves on Christthe way the truth and the life . Following Him they lived joyful and fruitful lives. Second the disciples knew Christ was on their side. They saw the creator of the heavens and earth being rejected suffer and lay down His life for them. Christ persevered to the end because He loved them and considered them precious. With the almighty God on their side they didnt need affirmation from people around them. By trusting in Christ they would not be put to shame .

        "content": "Major conflicts or contradictions in life can lead us to search for God. In Moses saw a bush on fire that didnt burn up. That unexplainable event attracted Moses away from tending his flock and brought him to God. A disrupting event in our life can turn us away from our normal path. Some examples include the bishops reaction to Jean stealing his stuff in Les Miserables being unable to graduate due to flunking a class we thought we knew well and feeling deeply lost after getting what our hearts intensely desire. When Moses walked over to the burning bush God called to him Moses! Moses! In the Bible the doubling of a word implies emphasis and doubling a proper name conveys emotional intensity. God wanted to be closer to Moses yet His holiness forbad Him. From a distance God told Moses He would rescue the Israelites through Moses . Similarly God wants to be closer to us but His holiness forbids Him to be close to sinful humans. So through Christ God came down to save us. Christianity has a lot of contradictions that are beyond our understanding. For example many things in life seem to be predetermined but we also have free will. Christs teachings in the Sermon on the Mount demand perfection yet Christ is extremely merciful and loving. He sacrificed Himself on the cross taking our place to be consumed by the wrath of God the Father. It is difficult for us to understand how we as sinners could be filled with Christs righteousness beauty and glory or how our God can be both full of love and truth mercy and holiness. God could be using contradictions to lead us to Him. Keep exploring and God will reveal Himself to you.",

        "content": "When we prioritize anything over God we have broken the first commandment. Breaking the first quickly leads to breaking other commandments. Lets consider an example. Many thirst for approval and would lie and cheat to get others acceptance. In this case approval has become an idol. Worshipping this idol can lead to breaking the ninth commandment. To illustrate Mary speaks falsely of Joes character. Christine knows Mary is wrong but Christine wants Mary to accept her so she pretends to agree. Because Christine values Marys acceptance over honesty Christine has lied against anothers character. If the meaning of our life and our hope rest on something other than God that thing will become our idol. Driven by the wrong thing would distort our life. So how do we get rid of our idols and improve permanently? First we need to agree that we have to change. Second we need to identify our idols the earthly objects that we base our hope and happiness on. Identifying the idol doesnt mean weve removed it. If we change because we are afraid of missing out on some earthly thing such change wont last. Or if we change because we think we are better than others such change also wont last. As soon as it becomes more profitable to change back well flip. If we can get something more for smearing others we would do it. In order to truly change we need to be driven by the right force from within. We change to follow God because He is so much wiser than we are. We change to follow God because God loves us which He demonstrated at the cross. Thus it is rational for us to follow Him. It is rational for us to change. Meditate on the love of God. Meditate on the Gospel. Even angels who are much more intelligent than we are long to look into it . It is easy for us to revert back to our old habits but if we continue to meditate on the cross we will gradually improve. We will focus more and more on God. Then one day we will see why Paul said the Gospel is the power of God .",

    "How Christ Changes People": {
        "content": "How does Christ change people? Lets see how Christ convinced a promiscuous and lonely Samaritan woman . To begin Christ talked to her. At that time Jews didnt mingle with Samaritans and men wouldnt talk in public to women they didnt know. Also she was an outcast . In approaching her Christ broke racial gender social and moral barriers and showed Himself as a bridge between polar opposites in society. What Christ was about to give to the woman was the gift of God. One with strength money power or other indicators of social status wouldnt have a higher chance to get it. It was and is a gift for everyone. Second Christ linked the Gospel to something important and desirable. Christ compared the Gospel to water which is paramount for survival. Unlike laws that we are forced to follow water is something one desperately needs. Lastly Christ showed her what she was pursuing would never satisfy her. When the Samaritan woman asked for the living water Christ told her to bring her husband a nonsequitur response. The woman had had five husbands and the man with her at that point was not her husband. Christ wanted her to see that what she was seeking be it water or men would never be enough. She always had to return for more. Irrespective of what we pursuemoney health possession beauty sex power friendship family importance or intelligencewe will never be satisfied. We always want more and these things can destroy us. But Christs living water wouldnt abuse us. We dont need to earn it. It is a gift. On the cross Christ asked for water which symbolized Christ experiencing unquenchable thirst when His Father had forsaken Him. Because of His suffering we can have the gift of the living water the gift that can fully satisfy us.",

        "content": "Loving our neighbors implies serving people very different from us or even offensive to us. How is that possible? The key is to focus on Christ. We could see the apostle Peters focus shifting from himself to Christ via two fishcatching incidents. In both cases Christ told him where to fish leading to lots of fish. The first time was when Peter first met Christ. Peters response to the spectacular experience was Go away from me Lord I am a sinful man! . Peters focus was himself. The second time was after Christs resurrection. As soon as Peter knew the person teaching them how to fish was Christ Peter at once jumped into the water to swim to Him . Peter could have run away because Christ might punish Peter for denying Him three times. Instead Peter swam to Christ at once. Peters focus had shifted from himself to Christ. Peter changed because Christ let him in and never let him down. Christ let Peter in by opening up to him making known to Peter everything He learned from the Heavenly Father . Christ never let him down. He even died for him to save him . Christ had become Peters greatest friend. Not just his great friend Christ also had filled Peters deepest needs. Christ is the way the truth and the life . Peter didnt have to yearn for others approval or material things on Earth. When Peter tried to compare himself with John Christ told Peter to focus on his own path and story and to focus on following Him . Peter became an overflowing spring that fulfilled the needs of countless people. But he didnt accomplish this by himself. Peter also became a part of the body of Christ which includes the Christian community. This community builds each other up helps each other and rejoices and mourns together. May the almighty Christ be our greatest friend and our focus. May we let Him fill our deepest needs. May we be a part of the community of Christ so that we might love and serve our neighbors.",

First the Bible declares that pleasing God depends on faith in Gods grace through Christ and not on our merit morality kindness religious behaviors or selfdenial. To go to God we must have faith that God is who He said He is the Trinity God who is just merciful allknowing and omnipresent who hears every word we pray and blesses those who earnestly seek Him. Without faith prayer is useless. The importance of faith is taught throughout the scripture. Justification righteousness and salvation are by faith through Christ not by observing any laws. When you dont trust a person you cant please him. A child always doubting his father wont please him. To doubt Gods power or goodness is to insult Him. If you distrust that God will keep His promises or if you question His power to save you or forgive your sin you assume God is a liar . You cant get anything from God if you dont trust Him. Also if you distrust Gods words promises or wisdom you will have difficulty loving God or being zealous for Him you wont appreciate his discipline nor rejoice in Him. There are many examples in the Bible. Through faith Enoch experienced no death. Without faith the Israelites couldnt get into Canaan . We must examine our faith carefully. Do we have childlike trust in Gods words or do we trust our knowledge judgment or invention more than God? We should integrate faith into every part of our life such as teaching working making money or raising our children. Trust that God will accomplish His work. Dont be afraid of trouble trouble helps us grow. We tend to trust God the most when things are the worst. Dont trust yourself or your work for salvation. Trust Christs work. God promised never to leave or forsake us . Whatever God has promised He can and will perform! So trust Him. Not by might nor by power but it is by Gods Spirit that anything is accomplished . A",

Isaiah contrasted Him to the Babylonian idols. God sustained rescued and showed the Israelites compassion from birth to death. But the Babylonian idols were their burdens instead . Christ came not to be served but to serve even by giving His life treating us far better than we deserve . God not only wants to help us but He is also infinitely competent . So pause and pray to God. Consult Him particularly when you arent sure what to do according to His will. If God tells you to be still you should let Him take over and just quietly observe . God told the Israelites to wait for Him and not to run to Egypt for help or fight for themselves. But they fought and quickly lost . God may fight for you as He split the Red Sea for the Israelites. Or He may fight through you as He helped David swing the stone at Goliath. If God tells you to act then let Him work through you . Note that even when you are charging on your war horses you still wait for the Lord listening to His voice . Also when you are working hard know that it is Gods grace working in you . Greatness is not measured by how many people work for you but by you working for many lifting them up like Christ sacrificing His life for us. Never act as if you are in charge and God is irrelevant.

The rich Abraham at left his hometown with no details from God . The Israelites walked across the Red Sea through parted water . Mary obeyed leading to virgin pregnancy .

Great people accomplish things through persisting even when no one including themselves feels like continuing. Announcing before we have it. Words have tremendous power when said in faith. Abram putting his reputation on the line changed his name to Abraham at when he had no child with his wife and when at least initially he was skeptical . Giving when we don't have it. Love requires giving. Be like God who gives . Money tests our faith. If we trust God in our eternal salvation we should trust Him in our finances too. Give to God first and He will provide . If we train our faith through giving like training our muscles we will experience God bailing us out. Thanking God before we receive it. Before receiving we should thank God as if we have . The Israelites walked around the highlyfortified Jericho walls for seven days thanking God. Then the walls fell . Trusting if we don't get it. Many suffer not getting Gods promises . Through suffering we learn. In this fallen world we wont understand many things. Trust that God is good with better plans and eternity to keep His promises. To have such faith read His words . Focus on His power. Remember what He has done for us and look forward to the joy before us. Our anchor is Christ He is the same yesterday today and tomorrow. Trust and obey for theres no other way.",

God is not obligated to redeem us He could have rejected us like He did the fallen angels. Our redemption is Gods grace a gift that we cannot repay. Our faith in God is also from God . God gives us wisdom to know Him. We are considered good and holy before God because of God. . We are reborn like being raised from the dead through the redemption . We are given the Holy Spirit as promise by the Father enabling Christ to be in us . With the Holy Spirit in us rivers of living water will flow from us. The Holy Spirit also serves as a deposit guaranteeing what is to come . We are preserved and protected by God . We are sufficient because of God . He is not just the source of all that is good but the medium through whom we receive it. Through Christ our mediator provided by Father we receive our redemption and we are reborn becoming good . God is not just the purchaser He also has paid the price with the ultimate sacrifice. Not just the source of all good and the medium to get them God is the good itself.

We should let God be the center of our plan. Then God will direct us . Also ask God to show us how to carry out the plan He lays out for us . Be humble and fully trust Him. Ask God for wisdom and He would give it to us . Second do not presume to have a future. We do not know the first thing about tomorrow . Our life is temporary like a morning mist that quickly vanishes. So do not boast or brag what you are going to do tomorrow. This is arrogance. We can live and do anything only if it is Gods will .

When he was twelve years old Jesus went with Mary and Joseph to Jerusalem for Passover. When the event was over His parents left for home with a large group but Jesus stayed behind discussing with teachers in the temple . A day later when Mary and Joseph found out Jesus was not with them they went back to Jerusalem to look for Him. After three days of searching they found Him. Mary was not pleased asking why He treated them like this. In response Christ questioned why they did not know He had to be in His Fathers house . During this event Jesus called God not Joseph His Father. In the Old Testament God is rarely referred to as Father. Basically Jesus told them His relationship with God was much more important and He did not have to obey them. Mary and Joseph were disturbed by how Christ treated them. They did not understand what He was talking about . James Elliot was speared to death while trying to evangelize to Indians in Ecuador. Shouldnt God have protected him? Later his wife Elisabeth explained Gods plan is beyond us and we should accept it as is. Often we are confused by what God does in our lives. We do not understand why we are in huge storms. Accept them. Hold onto His love for us. Christ the almighty God came on earth to serve us till death. We should contemplate what we know about Him and treasure our experience of Him . Gradually through grace we will grow in our understanding of Him. Meanwhile keep trusting and serving Him.",

Many of Christs parables are about wealth because our attitude towards it is a window into our hearts. Lets look at Christs viewpoint on possessions via the parable in . The person there kept storing up things thinking they would bring him security and happiness . Christ called him a fool which is very rare. If he died that day he wouldnt have been able to enjoy any of his possessions. The physical world is temporary and is not all there is. Christ had no material wealth on earth and yet He is worshipped by more than anyone today. Dont trust earthly things more than God. Let me have this car. Help me succeed in this deal. Make this woman love me. Get me this house. Make me beautiful. Build up my muscles. Dont look to earthly things to give us genuine security and happiness. Only God can do that. Dont place our hope in earthly things but in God and His plans. Focus on investing in Gods kingdom and His words which last forever . Be rich in Christ. Christ gave up His heavenly riches to become poor on earth. His sacrifice draws us to God. Through Christ we become rich and good in Gods eyes . Also focus on people rather than gathering riches for ourselves. talks about a shrewd manager putting money into people something that lasts. It is wise to save but be generous. Generosity can show our faith in God and our hope for the future. Generosity shows our love for others. Dont focus on loving yourself but love our neighbors as yourself. But dont be good to others just to claim a place in paradise. Our goodness is far from Gods standards. We are good before God only through Christ not through our behavior.

Each time Abraham believed God . He trusted and anchored himself in Gods words not his own abilities possessions relatives friends or looks. But Abraham did struggle in his faith. For example he asked God how he could be sure of His words . God told Abraham to get a few animals. At once Abraham knew God intended to sign a contract with him . In their culture to seal a deal both parties each got an animal cut it into pieces and grouped them into two columns and then both walked between the columns showing symbolically the party breaking the deal to be cut into pieces . In this case it was different. A blazing torch passed between the two columns. The torch signified God as in Mount Sinai and the pillars of fire in the desert. The process represented God making a deal with Abraham . But only God walked between the columns meaning that if Abraham failed God would take the punishment of being cut into pieces. Gods action enabled Abraham to live a life of faith. Keeping His promise God took the curse for our sins Christ was ripped into pieces and was cut off from God the Father . We worry disobey and doubt God. We think if we trust all the way we will miss out. Like Abraham John the Baptist also had doubts. John asked Christ whether He was the one. We can do the same. We can ask God How can we know you will follow through? How can we know we wouldnt let you down? Then listen to His response. Remember that Christ already paid the price by Himself.

        "content": "Three global religions consider Abraham as the father of their faith. Because of a call from God he lived a life at odds with his family society and culture. Lets learn about it in . Genesis described humans spiritual decay. But one ray of hope a single family still passed on the knowledge of God the family of Seth from whom came Noah and Terah the father of Abraham. At that time the culture was polytheistic even Terah worshiped other gods . Fortunately his son Abraham followed God. But Abrahams wife Sarai was barren. So this ray was flickering out spiritually and physically. Then God called Abraham. It was a call of grace because Abraham didnt deserve the call. Abraham wasnt qualified. The call changed him. The call was radical. God told Abraham to leave his country his people and his fathers household and go to the land I will show you . Note that at that time there was no Google map. By faith Abraham went not knowing where . God promised Abraham that he would be a great nation and all peoples on earth would be blessed through him. But Abraham never witnessed this. For his entire life Abraham lived between Gods promises and the reality. He might have been more comfortable just staying back in his fathers land but instead he listened to God. Over thousands of years all the promises gradually are coming true. Like Abraham we follow God by faith. Our life is between Gods promise and the reality. We may be more comfortable just living our old life. But all of Gods promises eventually will come true. God promised that through Christ we can be welcomed back to the Fathers house with all the glory and blessing. Gods call does not fit into our agenda. Gods call probably challenges major aspects of our lives. Gods call probably will take us out of our comfort zone. But trusting Gods call provides real security and gives us entirely new lives with radical new purposes. Trusting God will bring us to the ultimate promisedland.",

    "An Immigrants Courage": {
        "content": "It took courage for Ruth to leave the land of her birth. Lets learn from her story in the Book of Ruth. Naomi moved to Moab with her husband and two sons because of famine in Israel. Their two sons had Canaanite names and married Moabites who were traditionally bitter enemies of the Israelites No Ammonite or Moabite or any of their descendants may enter the assembly of the Lord not even in the tenth generation . Subsequently Naomis husband and the two sons died. In those days widows had difficulty surviving unless they had money or sons. Naomi had neither. When Naomi heard that there was food in Israel she and one of her daughtersinlaw Ruth returned to Israel. Typically immigrants leave their place of birth hoping for a more comfortable life. But not Ruth. In Israel Ruth had no family connections nor status. In fact Israelites saw Moabites as horrible wicked people. We could see the danger when Ruth picked leftover grain in an Israel field. The owner knew she had been good to Naomi. He suggested Ruth to stay in his field and said I have told the men not to lay a hand on you . Ruth left Moab because she loved Naomi and she recognized Yahweh as God implying her belief. In Ruth said to Naomi Your people will be my people and your God my God. May the Lord deal with me be it ever so severely if even death separates you and me. We can only postulate that Ruths faith came from seeing God in Naomis life. Because of Naomi Ruth took refuge in God . In turn Ruth redeemed Naomi from a life of bitterness and saved the line of David through which Christ would come. Christ was also an immigrant. He gave up His life to move to earth where He suffered terribly and died to redeem us from a life of hell. God the Father raised Him from the dead making His name above all names. Learn from Christ and Ruth. Dont focus on what the world considers as a good life. Surrender ourselves. Follow Christ. God will be with us and give us a great life.

        "content": "Why do we need friends and how do we make them? We need friends because we are made in the image of God. Our God the Trinity includes three entities. From eternity before the existence of the world these three entities are the best of friends. God also said it was not good for Adam to be alone . Adam needed someone suitable for him to be his helper whom he could share trust and love. It is also not good for us to be alone. So we need friends. What are the main attributes of a friend? First a friend lets us in his inner life willing to share with us his secrets. We should learn from Christ. He lets us in by sharing with us everything He learned from His Father . Christ lets us in by being with us. He doesnt lay out our whole life before us and leave. Instead through the Holy Spirit He dwells in us accompanying and guiding us along the way. Learn to open up to others but do it slowly. Dont force others to get into your inner life by opening up too quickly. Second a friend doesnt let us down. Christ never lets us down. There is no greater love than laying down ones life for ones friends . That was what Christ did and His sacrifice has given us life. Christ loves us not because we are good. We are far from it but He still loves us. Christ treats us as His friend yet we rebel against Him. We are not surprised if our enemies harm us but it is difficult to endure insults from our close friends. Since Christ treats us as His friends our rebellion hurts Him deeply. Learn from Christ regarding friendship. He lets us in by opening Himself to us and by being with us. Christ never lets us down. He even died for us. We should follow Him. Similarly we need friends because we are made in Gods image. To build friendship learn to let others in and not let them down.",

This started since Adam and Eve with Adam blaming Eve and Eve blaming the serpent. This tendency to shift blame still haunts us today. On judgment day we are accountable to God. We must give an account of ourselves to Him including everything we have done and every empty word we have spoken. . Our account to God also includes sins of omissionthat is the things we should have done and did not. God holds us accountable for what He has given us . Nothing is hidden from Him with all our secrets judged . Let us start today to be honest take responsibility of our mistakes accept our faults and stand up again. With Gods offer of forgiveness and grace we can have a fresh start. One secret to successful physical training is to have partners holding us accountable. They can encourage each other and keep each other focused on their goals. Similarly we should have an accountability partner to help train our character and train us to be godly . A successful accountability relationship is difficult. It requires honesty and takes courage. We can make our commitment with our partners to follow Christ. Confess sins to each other. Be honest and open. This will help us heal . Ask our partner to remind us of our commitment and the good thing we should be doing. This can help us do what we cannot by ourselves. Accountability can be a key factor in our progress towards godliness. It can push us toward love and good deeds . Such an accountability partner is Gods gift for us and since we will be accountable to God let us start with our accountability partners today.",

        "content": "Spiritual friendships are discovered made and last forever. And they are necessary. Pauls life fell into chaos after he went to Jerusalem but he was surrounded by spiritual friends everywhere he went . Needing friends is a sign of maturity and health. Before the fall in Genesis everything was good except for Adam being alone . We are built to need others. This is not a result of sin unlike our need for health being free from guilt and meaning in life. Friendship was a necessity even before the fall. Christ considered His disciples as friends . He regularly shared His inner thoughts with them. He wasnt afraid to open up to them His distress. Some dont want friends because of previous failed relationships. Growing older often leads to more responsibilities and less time for friends. But you still need them. Dont wait till you become desperate before you look for them. Second spiritual friendship is discovered. The essence of friendship is not about each other but about something in common that has captured your hearts. Friends come among those with common interests passions or goals. Those going nowhere will have no fellow travelers. Robbers have a common goal of robbing. They go rob and are friends with other robbers. Spiritual friendship arises among those who share a common love for God. The strongest experience is the grace of Christ. Spiritual friendship arises naturally among those with such experience. Third friendship is made through sharing each others feelings as when Paul and his spiritual friends prayed wept embraced and kissed possessions such as when Pauls friends opened their homes to him faith decisions sharpening each other as Paul at least listened to his friends counsel time as time for friendship can easily be pushed out by other demands and commitments as Luke though aware of the danger still went to Jerusalem with Paul . Lastly friendship lasts forever. Creation was the results of our Triune Gods friendship. Our destiny is eternal friendship. The purpose of creation is about making us friends. Redemption is about remaking us as friends. According to Christianity life is about friendship. Go get it. Our job is to summarize sermons. Thats what Tim Keller said.",

        "content": "How to raise children? Lets learn from Do not exasperate your children instead bring them up in the training and instruction of the Lord. This includes discipline or setting up firm rules and also includes counseling listening and reasoning. Teach them who God is to you. Share your testimony and point them to the Lord. Pray with them and for them. As parents we need to live lives consistent to our beliefs and strive to strike a balance between truth and love. If we have too much discipline we forget that they are not robots. If we focus too much on loving and nurturing we forget that they are not adults sometimes they must obey without fully understanding. They need to be independent and so we must learn to let go. Trust them and let them fail but do it progressively. Give them the support they need and do not push them to be independent too quickly. The above is difficult to do without the guidance of God and the Gospel. For example we may underdiscipline perhaps because we want their approval or are too eager for their love. But the Gospel frees us from such needs. Our approval is from God and God loves us. We may overdiscipline perhaps because we base our identity in them or consider them a reflection of ourselves and so we fear their failure. Again the Gospel frees us from such need. Our identity is in God. Some of us may not want our children to be independent perhaps because we want to be needed. We try to get from them what should be from God. Or some of us may push our children to be independent too quickly. This could be because we are selfish and only think of ourselves. We forget they are blessings from God. To conclude we should raise our children through God and the Gospel. We must balance truth and love dependence and independence and point them to the Lord.",

First we should focus on something else. Real friendship is built on a common foundation and interests. A person has no fellow travelers if he does not go anywhere. Second we should be a real friend ourselves. This requires us to have the capacity to give. Christ exemplifies real perfect friendship. He lets us in by revealing Himself to us . Also irrespective of what we do He cares for us to the point of sacrificing Himself for us. He does not let us down. With Christ as our real friend we have no fear of being let down by others. This gives us the capacity to give. A real friend probably has to be discovered. Once we find a real friend we have to strengthen it as our highly mobile society is quick to move people apart. In conclusion we must let Christ be the friend our hearts desire and in turn we will build real friendship with others. When we focus on following Christ we can be real friends and that is how we will have real friends. Adapted from a Tim Keller sermon. https//www.youtube.com/watch?v=TcVIQrXdE .",

        "content": "Today we look into our relationships with our parents and our children. The Ten Commandments teach us to honor our parentsnot love not trust not admire not enjoy and not obey but honor them. Some parents are obnoxious and make it difficult to love or enjoy them. Some parents are not trustworthy. Some parents are not admirable. Some parents are not safe to obey. Also one day a child should leave the parents authority and be united with his or her spouse . But we are still called to honor our parents no matter how flawed they are. This is a choice and is not sentimental. We are commanded to treat our parents with dignity courtesy and respect. We should try to follow the custom because what is considered respectful differs by culture. To honor them sometimes we need to forgive them particularly when they are really bad or manipulative. To honor is different than seeking their approval. Many yearn for their parents approval but we must remember that our parents cant be our God. We mustnt let our need to please them dominate us lest their approval become an idol. Remember that we have Gods unconditional acceptance. We dont have to prove that we are good. That knowledge can empower us to freely honor our parents. As to our children teaches us to bring them up in the training and instruction of Godagain not love trust admire enjoy or obey. Training involves discipline and instruction involves teaching and counseling. In traditional families fathers have absolute authority. After the industrial revolution many parents now leave home to earn a living and they delegate others to bring up their children. But parents should not have absolute authority and should not delegate. Parents need to bring their children up. This is a kind of servant leadership. The bringing up is in the discipline and teaching of God. To conclude we dont need to get our approval or acceptance from our parents or our children. Our approval and acceptance are from God. This will free us to honor our parents and to bring up our children in Gods training and instruction.",

God chose to bestow special grace to some people . He elected them as He pleased before the creation of the world . In a way this is similar to God sending rain to one town but not to another . God lets the gospel take root and sprout in some . Through the Holy Spirit He draws them in opens their eyes and turns them around. No one can take the everlasting elections out of the Fathers hand and Christ shall lose none . God will finish what He has started. Since Gods election isnt due to any of their works virtues or worthiness they should be humble and give God the glorify for His choosing and enlightenment. However God also wants all people to repent and all to be saved . All in here doesnt mean all individually but all sorts of people people of all different conditions. We dont understand why one is chosen and another is not. To accommodate our limited capacity God used human terms like He had ears and hands. Still we cant fully comprehend Him. God shows us the parts of His will that we ought to know. For the many aspects we dont understand we need to have faith that God is just. God wants all people to know Him and be saved . He reaches out His hands inviting all to Him . Those who refuse Him are condemned. So dont keep Him to ourselves. Instead invite unbelievers in and pray for their salvation.

God was obligated to keep His word and condemn them. Those elected to be saved go to the Father through Christ. They may be wicked but their salvation does not compromise His words holiness majesty truth justice goodness mercy and faithfulness. Through Christ Father can save the greatest sinners without approving their wickedness. Father bestows salvation to the poor and foolish the corrupted tax collectors the prostitutes the criminal next to Christ on the cross and some hearing Christs teachings only once . God chose to give the Jews the opportunities of His grace leaving to perish gentiles like the Egyptians Persians Greeks and Romans. But when the Jews rejected the Messiah Father replaced them with other nations . So for those saved be humble and praise God. Out of His sovereign pleasure He chose them before they were born. Ones salvation and righteousness depend on His will and sovereignty . But dont count on Gods mercy and continue to sin. Beware that salvation is not under our control though Father is bound by His word that anyone can go to Him through Christ . On the other hand dont be discouraged because of your wickedness. God can bestow salvation to the worst without compromising any of His attributes. God designs creation to glorify Himself and manifest His glory in all His characteristics including His holiness wisdom mercy justice and sovereignty. It pleases God to exercise His sovereignty and bestow salvation. Glorifying Himself in our salvation pleases Him greatly.",

Gods wrath is as much against them as it is against those damned in hell. Meanwhile their sins are constantly increasing and offending God tremendously.

No matter how moral strict sober or religious we are unless we are born again damnation will come swiftly with suffering for all eternity in Gods merciless vengeance. Dont wait till the day when He will only laugh and mock at our great suffering in hell . Now the door to salvation is open. He loves us and can wash us from our sins with His own blood.

In distinct contrast when Gods light shines in a person enlightening the person through the Holy Spirit the person will see Gods loveliness beauty and holiness and the glory of the divine displayed through Christ . Only God can give to humans what Christ has purchased. The opportunity to behold Gods beauty is Gods blessing to His dear children. As a result of such wonderful gifts His children will see their ugly souls and humble themselves making God bigger and themselves smaller. Then their guilty souls will rest.

He will discipline and refine those He loves while simultaneously we are forgiven and pleasing to Him . Because of Christ we have been made perfect once and for all . But the essence of Christian ethics is that we pursue holiness because we are holy . We seek to please God when we are already perfectly pleasing to Him . We depend on Christ for our righteousness and sanctification where we will be made holy gradually. Through faith in His grace God empowers us to realize our desire for doing His will. God is pleased with our works of faith. Christ gets the glory in us and we get the glory in Him . The faith for our justification is also the faith for our sanctification.

Holiness leads ones heart and life to conform to God and His will including being just excellent and loving and doing as He wills. Our life and words reflect our hearts. Our deeds reveal our faith. So without deeds there is no corresponding faith . Holiness involves conforming to Christ the Fathers expressed image . Christ is holy. He demands us to follow Him . Imitating Christ leads to holiness. Holiness implies conforming to Gods laws and commands such as those expressed in Psalm and the Sermon on the Mount. These laws are written in our hearts . Holiness is important because our just God must punish sins . God cannot unite with the unholy so the unholy cannot enjoy the love of God or the happiness of heaven. The unholy will not be admitted into heaven. If heaven were filled with the unclean heaven would become another hell. Only those born again can enter the Kingdom of God . Unless purified by the blood of Christ our sins will not be forgiven and will remain with us. We need to be made new with new attributes such as love. Without love we are nothing . How can we determine if we are living lives of holiness? Meditate on Gods holiness. Do our souls conform to it? Do we find delight in the meditation? Do our souls agree with Gods words which are written in our hearts? Do our souls love Gods commands? Does our life resemble in any way the life of Christ? Are there any similarities between us and the holy people such as Enoch Noah Abraham Moses David and Paul? Holiness is a necessity.

Nonbelievers of Christ can worship many idols but Christians may ignore the Holy Spirit and worship God less. Our goodness comes from the Holy Spirit. Being convicted of our sins and repenting are through the Holy Spirit. Yet many dont hold the Holy Spirit in high esteem. Believing in Christ has quenched our thirst. But do rivers of living water flow from us ? Many believers dont have abundant life. Lets understand the work of the Holy Spirit. First it is intimately intertwined with Christs work. For example unless we are born of the Spirit we cant enter Gods kingdom. But whoever believes in Christ shall have eternal life . In the Old Testament the Holy Spirit did many extraordinary works through the prophets. But during that time the Holy Spirit came and left not living in them. After Christs departure the Holy Spirit came to stay with us forever. The Holy Spirit takes what is from Christ to teach us . The Holy Spirit leads us to Christ conforming us to His likeness and glorifying Him. The work of the Holy Spirit is of incomparable value. Christ on earth was just with a handful of disciples but the Holy Spirit has dwelt within believers over the many centuries! The Holy Spirit generates rivers of living water in believers to flow from within them like divine light enabling others to see. The flow is spontaneous and perpetual. Whatever they do prosper . Wherever they are there is blessing. The church is glorified and they are glorified. We can easily obtain such work of the Holy Spirit. First believe in Christ by faith we will receive the Holy Spirit. Second pray and ask and our loving heavenly Father will give us the Holy Spirit . Ask God to make us all the Spirit can make us to be. Rivers of living water will flow from us blessing the people around us.",

Many believers focus on their intellect but if our brain power alone is sufficient to know God Pharisees with deep knowledge of the Bible would have accepted Christ . The intelligent can be misled by their knowledge and grow unwilling to seek God with humility. Intellect is important. For example we need to love God with all our soul as well but our intellect by itself cannot transform us into the worshippers God seeks. Christ taught us how God seeks those who worship Him in the spirit and in truth . Lets try to understand what this means. We worship God in the spirit because God is Spirit. And we need the Holy Spirit in us to guide and change us so we can know and worship Him . The Holy Spirit reveals to us our sins. Like Job when we see our iniquities and inadequacies we despise ourselves repent fall on our knees and worship God . We should let the Holy Spirit flow from us like rivers of living water glorifying the Heavenly Father . Worshipping God in truth implies we should have honesty and integrity in our worship. The person who prays to God should be the same person during the rest of the day. Christians should follow God in their everyday life. This is more important and difficult than public ministry. So do not be controlled by selfish desires or become jealous of one another and form cliques to fight with one another . Do not let transient worldly things take us over . Learn from Abraham. He worshipped God such that he was willing to offer to God that which was most precious to himhis son Isaac. He desired nothing more than God . In the garden of Gethsemane Christ prayed. He admitted His preference but still followed His Fathers will not His . To worship God truthfully and honestly we need to deny ourselves take up our cross and follow Him every day .

Three thousand were converted to Christ on that day. describe Christs disciples filled by the Spirit. The place shook and they spoke the word of God boldly. describes how Peter was astonished when those listening to him suddenly received the Spirit. They spoke in tongues and praised God so Peter ordered they be baptized in the name of Jesus Christ. In the above examples being filled with the Holy Spirit is illustrated as an unpredictable event that astonishes people. Not even the Apostles could initiate it. Though there may not be specific feelings or emotions something special will happen as Gods words are proclaimed God is glorified and people are changed. Furthermore a person filled by the Holy Spirit could be mistaken for being drunk . Since the Holy Spirit is a being we cannot be filled by a part of the Holy Spirit but the degree of influence by the Holy Spirit varies. The Holy Spirit can guide us into the truth tell us whats to come and testify about and glorify Christ . A person filled by the Spirit can give thanks to God for everything and in all circumstances. This can be due to trusting in Gods sovereignty and accepting whatever happens to be His will . Other attributes can include bearing the fruit of the Holy Spirit submitting to others due to reverence for Christ and constantly singing songs glorifying God . So how can we be filled? Christ said that the Holy Spirit would flow from a person who trusts in Him . In the manner that water needs to fill a cup before flowing from it so trusting in Christ leads to the filling of the Spirit. Also having Christs message richly dwell in us has similar effects as being filled by the Spirit. See the similarity between and both books written around the same time by Paul.

It is a multifaceted fruit and includes the attributes of love joy peace patience kindness goodness faithfulness gentleness and selfcontrol. Having one attribute but lacking another is not the fruit of the Spirit. For example peace requires gentleness. This peace comes from knowing that God is in control and we put ourselves in His hands. Worry and anxiety could sprout from our desire to control the future which is born from arrogance. Peace attained through power isnt the fruit. Love requires being faithful and faithfulness requires loyalty and courage. A partner who leaves you when you are in danger or a friend who quits when you are attacked doesnt have love with faithfulness. Selfcontrol requires love and gentleness. Otherwise we can become downright cruel. But selfcontrol also should not be based in pride. Some say that boys shouldnt cry because only girls cry. Such selfcontrol distorts us. Joy could help us make friends but to keep the good ones requires faithfulness. Kindness and love require selfcontrol. Without selfcontrol love could lead to indulgence and tolerance could lead to lacking discipline and breaking promises. This isnt the fruit.

Our original nature is arrogant which God detests and punishes . Earnestly strive to have a humble gentle and loving spirit . This is the spirit of Christ on earth. Such spirit of charity will lead to getting His rich promises and the crown of glory in heaven.",

        "content": "In the story of Jekyll and Hyde Jekyll takes a potion and becomes the completely selfish and wicked Hyde who takes control of Jekyll. In us we also have both good and bad sides that are constantly at war. Lets learn from . In the passage Paul describes our having desires for evil and good and our inability to beat our evil desire. God tells us we shouldnt take the fruit. But with the devil tempting us and with the fruit seemingly good to us we take it . The law showed Paul what he ought to do. Before Paul relied on Christ Pauls evil desire used the law to temp him enticing him to do what he should not do. Paul knew he could not beat his evil desire . Similarly our evil desire could use Christs teaching to temp us enticing us to do what we should not do. Before we rely on Christ our performance defines how good or bad we are and who we are . But in many situations we just do the bad and cant do the good. To save us God poured His wrath on Christ punishing Christ for all our wrongs . If we rely on Christs sacrifice we become perfect before God . Through Christnot through our behaviorwe become Gods beloved children. Also God loves us to the point of sacrificing Christ His only son for us. We should live for and serve the one who loves us so much. We should do good to delight Him . Though our evil desire is still lurking in us the evil desire cant control us like before . This is because who we are depends on Christ not our behavior. The Spirit that resurrected Christ now dwells within us and can help us beat our evil desires. With that we can live a life of following God .",

    "Is Born Again Just a Fancy Marketing Term?": {
        "content": "Christ told Nicodemus to be born again . Was this just a fancy marketing term to intrigue Nicodemus? Nicodemus was a Pharisee on the Jewish ruling council suggesting he was a fervent successful and highly honored follower of Jewish law. Yet Jesus told him to be born again. Starting all over again is not just a call for the wicked or the weak to improve but even the most respected. Lets learn what born again means from . Born again gives us a living hope . What we expect of the future directly shapes how we live today. Without a vibrant hope for something much bigger than ourselves many of us live for nothing but selfish desire which inevitably leads to a meaningless life that amounts to just fidgeting aimlessly while waiting for death. Christ on the cross has given us a living hope of a wonderful salvation with nonperishable inheritances in heaven . With this hope our joy and sadness are not dictated by our environment. This hope shifts us away from depending on our power wealth and other earthly things to rescue us . With this hope we can rest in Christ and His salvation. On Earth pain and suffering are common but suffering should drive us deeper into the living hope which can give us joy even in the midst of great pain . We cannot have this new hope or get this new birth through our effort. To be born again is to be brought on by Christ . We should trust in Christ to bring us a new beginning and give us a new hope. We will see the world through the lens of the Gospel shifting our focus from worldly things to Christ. Then gradually we will change and grow.",

        "content": "Many want others to say they are good. Some seek Botox liposuction or selfesteem therapy. Others fight to get into a good school or company. Some seek a trophy wife while others go so far as to kill themselves as in the Japanese practice of seppuku. As we age such desires are met differentlyfrom being recognized as brave smart or good to attaining financial or other success in the society. Many strive to earn praise from an important person. Disappointment kicks in when they find out the person is not that important or the person is not good enough to judge them. In the end they may not even know what they want. We want someone big to approve of us. But the biggest is God. The Bible explains that Gods approval is won in being righteous before God. Lets learn from where a Pharisee considered himself righteous. The Pharisee prayed. He started with thanking God but immediately turned to declaring himself better than others. He used his own metrics to determine himself being better He was not a robber or an adulterer he fasted twice a week and he gave away percent of his earnings . His metrics included fasting which was a cultural or a personal preference. The Pharisee set his own rules and he relied on them to feel good about himself and look down on others. Then a tax collector prayed. In those days tax collectors were considered evil like gangsters. He knew he was bad and he asked for Gods mercy. In the end the Pharisee was lost while the tax collector was accepted by God . Dont lean on your behavior. Look at Christs life. Our behaviors are so far off. Instead rely on Gods mercy. Rely on the death on the cross of His only Son. Only then can we find Gods approval. In spite of all our flaws we still can be His wonderful children! Dont set up your own rules to determine what is good and bad. Instead trust God and use His rules.",

        "content": "We live in a selfabsorbed society where few volunteer for the common good. But many top philosophers tell us that selfcenteredness is the source of suffering. How can we fix this? Lets learn from . In this passage Isaiah saw the glory and holiness of God . In Hebrew repetition shows magnitude. Here holy is repeated three times implying infinite brilliance beauty and significance. The encounter changed and deepened Isaiahs understanding of God. Isaiah was crushed and reacted by cursing himself . Seeing the greatness exposed his inadequacies. Job Moses and Peter had similar experiences. Isaiah was a skilled and intelligent communicator from a royal family. At that time King Uzziah had died and the society was in bad shape. It should have been his time to shine yet Isaiah saw how unworthy he and his people were . Then God cleansed Isaiah . Isaiah was humbled by his inadequacies but he was bold because of Gods cleansing and acceptance. After that God offered Isaiah a job without telling him what it entailed. Isaiah immediately accepted . For the rest of his life Isaiah would preach with no results no conversion . The Israel nation was like a tree cut down to its stump but God told Isaiah the stump would grow again . Gods holiness might not bring earthly benefits. But after seeing His holiness Isaiah focused on God ignoring his own needs fulfillment and goals. Independent of the environment Isaiah adored and served God for the rest of his life. We tend to treat God as our personal ATM. Meeting God would totally change us. Encountering Christ would show our inadequacies humbling us while making us bold! Isaiah didnt earn his selfworth through his own effort neither do we. Christs sacrifice cleanses us leading to Gods acceptance our supreme position and boldness. Encountering Christ changes us from selfabsorbed to focused on Him. We can persevere even when our environment is terrible. We can adore and serve Him for the rest of our lives. Also one day Christ will come back. The stump will grow. And everything will be wonderful again!",

Christ addressed him as Israels teacher . He was influential rich welleducated and probably old. Nicodemus visited Jesus secretly at night perhaps to do some backroom politicking with Jesus. Christ told him pointblank he must be born again . He had to start all over again because everything he hadall his accomplishmentsmeant nothing. Some consider being born again to be reserved for the broken and outcast. Nicodemus did not fit that stereotype. If Nicodemus must be born again shouldnt we also? This new birth radically changes a persons priorities and how one relates to the world . One becomes a different person like a plant with new roots and different fruits. Nicodemus addressed Jesus as Teacher but Jesus corrected him telling him that He came to save and be lifted up on a cross so people could live again and have eternal life in Him . Nicodemus asked how can someone receive such a thing . Like a mother giving birth to a baby one does not become a baby by trying hard . This new birth is brought on by looking up to Christ . This new birth is through God putting His Spirit into us . After Christ was crucified Nicodemus took pounds of burial materials and wrapped Christs body with spices in strips of linen . In those days this type of work was reserved for women. Nicodemus had been changed into a new person. Looking up to Christ and letting the Spirit give us a new life will totally change how we see things and relate to people. This will give us new hope in Christ.",

        "content": "What does it mean for God to be our refuge Lord treasure and counselor? How does He bring us into everlasting pleasure? Lets learn from Psalm a psalm by David. This psalm begins with David taking refuge in God by asking for his protection. God provided David the safest place . To David God was his Lord and his supreme treasure over everything. David wouldnt even mention the names of other gods though he would find delight in other righteous people. David chose God over everything else and God was all David needed to give him the greatest joy. Also God would protect Davids lot and set his boundary to position him at the best place bringing him delight and a wonderful future . To David God was his trusted counselor. God gave David refuge when he was in danger. God enlightened him on what to do and where to go ensuring David to have everything he needed and to be very wellpositioned. So David was confident and would not be shaken . To David God would not leave him among the dead but instead let David enjoy Him forever . This assurance is peculiar because the prophet Samuel told David he would die and rest with his ancestors. Samuel also predicted that the kingdom of one of Davids descendants would last forever . So would David die and rest with his ancestors or would he be coming back from the dead? David didnt really know but we do now. The Apostle Peter explained that in Psalm though David didnt fully understand he was referring to the resurrection of Christ . All who trust Christ are united with Him in His triumph over death. The Holy Spirit who raised Christ from the dead will give all believers everlasting life . God will teach them the path of life and will eternally fill them with joy .

    "How God Made Me Happy in Him": {
        "content": "Life should be devoted to pursuing pleasure in God to fill us with joy in Him . God wired us to seek joy and increase our pleasure. Unlike the stoics we should not try to avoid happiness. We sin because sin is pleasurable. The way to eliminate sin is to replace it with something that gives us more pleasure. If we have more pleasure in God than in sin we will not sin but rather shine in this world . If we focus on money fame sex or earthly power in pursuing happiness we are too easily satisfied. Consider the wonderful promises in the Bible. Since Christ offers us infinitely more joy we should focus on pursuing Him. It is important to glorify God. He created the universe including us to display His glory . Can we glorify God while pursuing happiness? Daniel Fuller CS Lewis and Jonathan Edwards teach us that we can . God reveals Himself to our minds and our hearts. If we can rejoice in Him He is glorified. If we prefer Him and want to be with Him over everything on earth we honor Him. Rejoicing also leads to praise which expresses what we value. If we dont enjoy and value the subject we praise we are hypocrites. But we spontaneously praise what we enjoy. So if we rejoice in God we will praise Him. Praising not only expresses but increases and completes our enjoyment. Thats why God commands us and the psalmists taught us to praise Him. In other words our happiness in God glorifies Him. When we are satisfied in God we praise Him and He is glorified. It is more blessed and joyful to give than to receive . Loving others will draw them to us and we can draw them to God. This will give them great joy and in turn will increase our happiness. Loving others is the natural overflow of our joy in God.",

        "content": "Typically we go to God because we want things. That may be why Satan challenged God over Job if God took away the lots of possessions He had given to Job Job would curse God . But after God allowed Satan to take from Job everything other than his wife Job still praised God because he knew he could not take anything with him when he died and everything was in Gods hands . The Bible teaches us to rejoice in the Lord alwaysin health sickness wealth or poverty . For example David glorified God in the desert of Judah and considered Gods love better than life . When Habakkuk had nothing not even food he still was joyful in God and considered God his Savior . Why should we still be joyful in God when externally we are in desperate shape? First know that God is the Almighty and He loves us. God is the Almighty who created the universe and He loves us. He sent us His beloved Son so we may live. Christ suffered not to bring us wealth or fame He suffered to bring us back to God. Hence we should focus on God the Creator not the things He created. All things we enjoy should point us to the Almighty. We should treasure and love God above everything. If we love Him we should do what He wants us to do though we know the essence of loving is not in performing tasks. If we love God we should love our neighbors as fellow imagebearers of God. Paul described the Macedonian Christians as being very generous even when they were in severe trial and probably in poverty . Treasuring God over all things means considering Him as the most desirable giving us the most satisfaction. When we are most satisfied in God He is most glorified in us. Glorifying Him is the main reason of our existence . Pray and ask the Holy Spirit to help you so that God is your ultimate delight and enjoyment.",

        "content": "Life can be full of sorrow and pain. To survive many become hardened and callous but God replaces the heart of stone in His children with a heart of flesh making them more vulnerable yet no one could take away their joy. How does that work? Lets learn from . The source of joy in Gods children is the Gospel the good news that gives us great joy. . The Gospel depicts Christ breaking into a world of despair initially devastated but triumphing at the end. Through Him we are accepted by God no matter what we have done and are given a clean conscience. This brings us great joy and boldness. This joy is permanent as it rests in Christ and is independent of circumstances. This joy also comes from obeying Christ. Through our obedience Gods Spirit can operate in us in the most powerful way . As an analogy to play music well requires years of difficult scale practice but gradually becomes more enjoyable. Dont compromise with counterfeit joy by pursuing worldly things. Idols make us feel good initially but curse us later. For example if career is our idol as we move up we feel good. But when we get stuck or go downhill we feel pain because of the curse of the career idol. The joy in Gods children comes from hope. The opposite of joy is not sorrow but hopelessness. Losses on Earth cause grief but Gods children grieve with a hope for something much better . Look at Christ He ran the painful race for the sake of the joy before Him . The cross comes before the crown. Such hope on eternal things enabled early Christians to sing praises while being mauled by lions. The privileges of being with God and enjoying Him outweigh any present temporary sorrow. On Earth the joy in Gods children coexists with sorrow . It is similar to a woman after giving birth where she is both in joy and pain. Go to Christ. Pray to Him. Follow Him and hold onto that wonderful hope. Then nothing can take away your joy.",

In the US some people sue and assume the side with the truth will prevail. But in reality all things fall short and are subject to decay including family and relationships. Anything good that happens to us is grace. Thank God for it. Just dont be shocked by bad events. Christ wept before the tomb of Lazarus. Sufferings and death may not be blessings in disguise. Christ hated death . The death of a child might spur the creation of new laws but can such laws heal the wound? God didnt promise His children a comfortable life in this world. Christ didnt suffer so we wouldnt suffer rather he promised we would. We dont follow Christ because it is comforting encouraging or exciting. We follow Him because He is the truth. However God did promise to accept us as we are. Through Christ we look good in His eyes . God did promise we would be more like Christ a person of courage truth and love . Christ said I am the resurrection and the life . One day He would make us new with no more death. Further God did promise to glorify His children . This glorification is in past tense implying a certainty. Christ suffered for the joy set before Him . Paul suffered but knew that the glory to come eclipsed his sufferings and pain .

Lets learn from Nehemiah. First divide the dream into smaller tasks. To make the work manageable Nehemiah separated the wall into more than twenty sections. He used the existing ten gates as markers starting from the Sheep Gate and going counterclockwise. Second share ownership of the dream with others. Nehemiah always used the word we. Ownership increases motivation. He also showed how the dream would benefit others for example having people build wall next to their own house . Third develop a cohesive team to build something bigger than yourself. Nehemiah used the words next to him/them times. Typically two is better than one . Jesus had a team and Paul worked with partners . Strive sidebyside with others to bring glory to God . Fourth create workgroups around preexisting relationships. Nehemiah organized workgroups based on priest ministry geography family and profession . There was no mention of any professional builders. Fifth love your neighbors but invest more in those who bear more responsibility. Nehemiah didnt waste time on those refusing to join . He didnt speculate why. We dont even know our own motivation let alone others. Christ had twelve disciples but focused on Peter James and John . Sixth never stop saying thank you. Live in gratitude and appreciation . When you recognize others be specific with their names and tasks done. Nehemiah mentioned names even the volunteers parents.

First it lists four causes of conflicts Basic needs not met. Some Jews even lacked food . Falling behind. Some mortgaged their essential assets for food . Leaders insensitive to their followers. Some had to borrow to pay tax . Feeling powerless. Some had to let their children be slaves for food . Nehemiah chapter lists five ways Nehemiah gained respect by resolving these conflicts Empathize. The above issues made Nehemiah very angry . People do not care what we know until they know we care. Pause and think before speaking . Be quick to listen but slow to speak . Resolve conflicts privately first. Nehemiah first talked directly to those causing the conflicts before addressing them publicly . Search for appeal to and bring out the good in others . Do not label them badly but appeal to the good they could do. Do things with humility and generosity . Reject entitlement and remain humble. We must not use our power to enrich ourselves at the expense of others. Though Nehemiah was the governor out of respect for God he did not eat or demand the food allotted to the governor place heavy burdens on the people he was governing allow his assistants to lord over the people nor take any land . Instead he was generous to the needy putting the needs of others above his own. Every day he provided food for people because of their heavy burden . Furthermore Nehemiah set good examples. He and his men were devoted to building the wall . After we are dead how will people remember us? Consider that and act accordingly . To conclude if you want to earn others respect empathize think before speaking appeal to the good sides of others be humble and generous particularly to those in needs and set good examples.",

For those ashamed of Him He will be ashamed of them later. Those who acknowledge Him before others will be acknowledged before His heavenly Father . Also acknowledging Him will put them among the most blessed such as the angels in heaven. If we so acknowledge and live consistently we may influence others and receive great blessings because it demonstrates that we are not of the world. But beware that the world will attack us . II. Our love comes from knowledge and faith knowing and believing that God loves us so much that He gave His only son so we may have eternal life . Consider how God has chosen us redeemed us through His sacrifice and taken us into Him. Look at His mercy supporting us daily. This will create in us a love for Him. If we dont love Him we are extremely ungrateful. In this way such love will come naturally. It cant be forced and isnt because of duty. We just cant help but love Him because He first loved us. But like love for our children our love for God doesnt come out all the time. III. Our love is based on a great mystery. It is a mystery why God loves us. We can only attribute it to His grace and faithfulness. Give God all the glory. IV. Our love is a force sustained by a higher force which is Gods love to us. Gods love is extremely powerful.

We True spirituality is to love God with all our heart soul and mind and to love one another as ourselves . When we love God we will love what He loves also. Such love is more vital than to be a scholar of the Bible. Knowledge is valuable and indispensable in our life. We need to use our Godgiven mind to understand and love Him. But knowledge by itself does not bring life. Intelligence even can hinder us in following God if it leads to arrogance. Gods revelation goes to the humble . Having such love is more valuable than serving as a missionary in a faraway land. Without love even if we give all we have to the poor and suffer we gain nothing. Without love even if we have the faith that can achieve great things we are nothing . We need to love God more than our own ambitions or money. We cannot serve God and money simultaneously. Note that being wealthy and loving God can coexist and rarely do we see a beggar who does not love money . But why should we love God? We should love God because He first loves us . Meditate on the love of God. In the garden of Gethsemane Christ was overwhelmed with sorrow to the point of death . He went through excruciating pain and was crucified on a cross. At one point even God the Father forsook Him . Christ went through hell so that we would not have to. Ask God to make us see clearly and comprehend deeply His love for us. We should love God because He has forgiven our sins. We have made lots of mistakes alienating ourselves and hurting others. Our iniquities continue even after our commitment to follow Christ. Ask God to open our eyes to see the seriousness of our sins. The more we realize His mercy in forgiving our sins the more we love Him because whomever has been forgiven little loves little .

Travelers sometimes depended on local people to take care of them at times waiting outside a city gate for residents to invite them in and provide them lodging. Jewish hospitality could go even further. Their laws required them to love foreigners partially because they themselves were foreigners in Egypt . Similarly Christians should be hospitable to strangers and should proactively protect the marginalized . Where do we get the impetus to help them? We are more inclined to be good to our neighbors because they could help us later. But most likely we would never see a stranger again. First know that things on earth are transient. They do not belong to us. They are not here just for us. At best we could only keep them for a very short time. Also remember that what we have are gifts from God. So dont focus on using them solely for our own benefits forgetting the needs of others. Use them to benefit the community to benefit others as well. For example build stable families to benefit our children. Second know that God is always with us. Though we have turned away from God so as to run our own lives God has promised us unconditionally that He would not leave us nor forsake us . This was shown by Christ sacrificing Himself for us. To make us children of God Christ suffered terribly forsaken by both humans and God the Father . Third know that Christ has prepared our real home with God the Father . It is a glorious place in the house of God . Lets look forward to it . In conclusion be aware that things on earth are transient. Nothing on earth could endure the test of time. But God loves us and is always with us. He has a wonderful place prepared for us in heaven so look forward to our permanent home that is to come. For our short time on Earth let us be good to strangers as God has been to us. It is possible that you might be entertaining an angel .",

        "content": "A Christian marriage is based on deep appreciation and respect for Christ and humbly submitting to each other . Marriage is not for status or a sense of security. It is also not for fulfilling our needs like consumers looking for products to satisfy them. Instead Christian couples should submit to each other each committing to serve the other. Wives should learn to grant leadership to their husbands while husbands should learn to love their wives as they love their own bodies. Each side acts appropriately even if the other side doesnt reciprocate. Submitting and serving do not equate to giving in. Look at Christ. He loves us and served us to the point of death but He confronts us with the truth to help us grow and be holy. We shouldnt be selfcentered because we know we are sinners saved by Christ. We shouldnt be needy for others affirmation since we know the Almighty God loves us. Also note that marriage is not the ultimate relationship and will not fill the deepest void in our hearts. Only Christ can. Dont think that marrying the right person will guarantee a perfect life having a wonderful family will be nirvana or marrying the right person will make us somebody. No one can replace God in our life. Putting someone in the place of God will totally destroy our relationship with the person. Furthermore dont worry excessively about not finding the right person. There is no ideal mate. Even if you think you have found a perfect match that person will change and will be influenced by others. So dont be too cautious. To conclude Christ should be our ultimate spouse who loves us and never lets us down. Let Him be the center of our life so that we may love and serve our earthly spouses.",

    "Cultivating a Healthy Marriage": {
        "content": "A healthy marriage needs work and regular attention to cultivate it. Marriage should make your spouse holy through your sacrifice . Husbands and wives take on different roles. The husband humbly leads to build up his wife while the wife plays a helper role to build up her husband. Both submit to help the other. To help you need to understand your spouse deeply. For example one may want to spend time together when the other wants to have some solitary meditation. One may vent about a boss being unreasonable and seek emotional support while the other tries to solve the problem without empathizing. When there are problems focus on the problems not the person. Step off the battlefield and objectively look at the complications. If it is a feeling issue focus on addressing emotions more than facts. If its your problem dont make excuses. Admit it. Offer to change after things have calmed down. If its your spouses problem forgive first because Christ has forgiven our mistakes. Then critique yourself and admit mistakes no matter how small they are. After that tell the truth lovingly so your spouse can grow. Develop an environment secure for criticism. Sex is a blessing between couples. Dont deprive the other side of it . What happens in bed can affect other parts of the relationship. Sex is not a place to perform but to love. Unlike the woman the man is ready for sex quickly not requiring much context. That may be why pornography can be more seductive to men. So a husband needs to learn to be slow while a wife needs to learn to be more responsive. Do some spiritual things together regularly such as praying before sleep. Emotion can start the engine but marriage should have a deep unity maintained by will and strengthened by habit. A healthy marriage needs to be cultivated. May the grace of Christ be the impetus of our love. In light of what He has done for us serve your spouse and help your spouse be a more wonderful person.",

First we remember that we were nothing. Now we are children of God entirely because of Christ not because of our performances accomplishments or love. Christ sacrificed dearly for us and our spouses. So at least out of reverence for Christ we should serve our spouses with an unselfish heart gifted us by the Holy Spirit . Marriage is a permanent exclusive public and legal commitment to share your entire life together. This commitment should override your feelings and emotions. Your commitment investment in the relationship and love toward your spouse strengthen each other. Where you invest your time and effortwhere your treasure isis where your heart will be. Marriage should be prioritized above all other relationships. It is where a man leaves his parents and unites to his wife . Most other societies emphasize children and parents but in Christianity marriage is the vortex of your life. The relationship with your spouse must come before that of your parents children friends and career . Differences in upbringing previous family patterns and previous ways of living can lead to misunderstandings and severe conflicts within a marriage. You need to understand your spouse deeply. Sit down discuss the differences and change. Let marriage be a fresh start it has the power to change the course of your life tear you down and build you up. Marriage isnt a human invention and its primary function isnt for your happiness. Marriage was created by God to make you holy and blameless . It is the most intense relationship because you cant hide from your spouse. You are forced to see your mistakes selfishness and prejudices God makes you confront them through marriage. Love is something only a HolySpiritcreated unselfishness can maintain. So go to God in your marriage and rely on Him.",

Out of pride they stopped glorifying God and sought to make a name for themselves and possibly make themselves equal to God . But pride may not be the only reason for Gods intervention. Babel wasnt just a tall building. Babel was also a city. Through language confusion they stopped building the city . God called humans to fill the earth and multiple . But the people of Babel built the city so they wouldnt be scattered over the face of the earth . They wanted to consolidate and strengthen their power. The city gave them a sense of security. We see similar events in Acts. Initially the church in Jerusalem was warm and comfortable with thousands converted. They were learning Gods words fostering fellowship eating together sharing everything and enjoying the favor of all the people. They could even communicate in different languages . But had they forgotten God telling them to spread the gospel to the ends of the earth? Stephens speech in Acts recounts Abraham leaving his homeland and changing the world Joseph being exiled to Egypt saving and growing the entire Israel tribe the Israelites experiencing wonders in Egypt like the splitting of Red Sea and Moses receiving the laws at Mount Sinai and standing on a land God called holy ground. None of these events happened in Jerusalem. The focus shouldnt be Jerusalem their comfort zone or their temple . After Stephens speech great persecution scattered Christs followers throughout Judea and Samaria Paul was transformed and the gospel was widely spread . If we try to consolidate power and control our future with our ability we will experience life like a little boat in a wild sea violently tossed by huge and unpredictable waves. Dont focus on your fragile security name influence and power. Dont focus on strengthening your power. Instead forget ego and security. Trust that God controls everything and find peace in that.

Instead of accepting our mistakes we blame others and God. Look at Adam and Eve. Initially they were happy in the Garden of Eden open to and accepted by God each other and themselves. Then they ignored what God told them and became their own judges. They were afraid and they hid . They also blamed others. Adam blamed Eve and God for putting Eve there . Eve blamed the serpent and indirectly God for putting the serpent there . Totally distracted they missed their main mistake which was disobeying God. How to get out?

Nothing could separate us from His love . Not just loving us God delights in us . With the almighty loving us so much we shouldnt be afraid and insecure . Further in Christ we belong to a body . As different parts of the body we have our different strengths and weaknesses serving different functions . Our strengths are Gods gifts. There is no room for pride. Discover our strengths and use them diligently and effectively. Our weaknesses help us be more interdependent and humble. There is no room to feel inferior.

They might not have understood why they suffered which can be a source of pain by itself. Christians may even weep more than others. Our hearts of stone have been changed to hearts of flesh making us more vulnerable to feel pain than before . Even Christ the perfect human suffered. When we suffer we must not give in to selfpity. Our suffering is nothing compared to what Christ went through for us. If we suffer in following Christ then we should count it as a blessing . When we suffer have faith that God is still with us. No matter what weve done Christ has already endured our punishment. Be assured in Gods promise of His grace and eternal glory with us forever. Honestly express your feelings in prayer. One psalmist even asked God to go away so he could enjoy life again before dying . God understands our frustration. When Christ was in deep sorrow in the Garden of Gethsemane and when God the Father abandoned Him on the cross Christ honestly expressed His pain. And be patient. Persistent prayer will end in praise. Many Psalms begin with the psalmists crying out to God but end in praise. Finally be proactive. Those who sow with tears will reap with songs of joy . In",

        "content": "Fear and anxiety are compelling forces. The fear of losing can drive professional athletes to work very hard. But such emotions can also be debilitating. Sports can take over the life of professional athletes. One day when their careers are over they could be lost. Losing their identity and worrying about their future can drive them to selfdestructive behavior. The pressure of outside forces couple with our own selfdoubt and guilt can paralyze us. In Psalm David was fleeing from Absalom his favorite son. David was outnumbered by enemies on all sides and many feared that God had deserted him . They questioned Davids authority to be their king which threatened Davids foundation and identity. Lets learn from Davids reactions. First David trusted that God had not left him. God was a shield around him answering Davids prayer from His holy mountain . From God came deliverance . Second Davids glory is from Godnot from his army political power moral standing or love of his people and his family all of which he had lost. It was God who lifted his head high . Similar verses in Genesis show God assuring Abraham that He was Abrahams shield and his very great reward . Despite their imperfections both Abraham and David were protected in their faith in Gods love and mercy. Similarly we can be Gods cherished children and the almighty God can be our glory. Because of his trust in God David did not suffer from fear anxiety or insomnia . Davids head was lifted high . After all he was Gods anointed king. Third David focused on Gods people. With the king fleeing the country was likely in chaos. David asked God to strike his wicked enemies and to bless His people . Likewise we shouldnt think only of ourselves but think about others. In love there is no fear . Thus we must rely on Christ to fight fear and anxiety. He is our protection and He is also our glory. And we shouldnt just think about ourselves but focus on others as well.",

Christ on the cross died a violent death sacrificing His peace so we could have eternal peace . Think about Gods love. Second thank God as you present Him your requests . God may not grant our requests but He will provide. No matter how bad we have been we know God has accepted us through Christs death on the cross.

We often feel anxious when we desperately work towards certain goals without achieving them. We try hard to defend and prove ourselves but often fall short. Our environment also causes anxiety. In The Trial Frank Kafka describes a man accused of a crime that can not be defined. Initially assuming the world a rational place and he a decent person he thought he would be released. But he was executed. The world is not rational. In the words of Sigmund Freud Most people are trash. How can we find peace? First we must accept that we are in a very bad shape. We constantly fail in following the two biggest commandments loving God with all of our hearts and loving others as ourselves. We often fall short of the same metrics we judge others with . We must accept our failures. By our effort we could never be accepted by God . Dont seek rest in your accomplishments relationships wealth or abilities. All these things could change overnight. How can we rest on something that constantly changes? How can you sleep on a bed that keeps moving? Instead rely on Christ. Rely on what He has done for us . David could rest because he depended on God. He didnt find his glory in his power or wealth but in God alone .

Todays lovers can be tomorrows enemies. Nothing on earth can give us security. Second we must recognize that one day we will die .

They ask God to pay for their sins with the blood of Christ thus reuniting themselves with God. Fourth know that as long as one is alive one still has hope . History shows us that our world is without justice and fairness. Gaining the world is not worth losing ones life . Without Christ paying for sins life is hopeless. But if we accept Christ as our savior today His death and resurrection will reunite us with God and we will be transformed at least in the following ways. First we will accept God as our Lord. Everything we have is from God and belongs to Him. We are just custodians managing whatever God gives us. Whatever situation we are in we give thanks to Him .

Christ is God and also works for the Father. Furthermore Christ intercedes for us before God . Third the worst is over. United with Christ we have passed from death to life. Baptism signifies our death burial and resurrection with Christ through faith . But our glorious life is hidden with Christ in God . We cant see and taste our true life .

Then we will know and be satisfied of Gods will. Note that the will of God has two meanings. One is His sovereign will thats going to happen no matter what. Such could involve someone sinning. For example Christs crucifixion was Gods plan . For such predestined events to occur Herod and others had to murder Christ . Ultimately it will be for the good. His sovereign plans always happen . Another meaning of Gods will is what God wants us to do and to be . Whoever does the will of God lives forever . But many of us dont causing lots of pain and suffering. God hates evil behavior and we need to believe God is sovereign. Ultimately the evil behaviors are for the good. In the case of to know Gods will is to know what God wants us to be and do to get our minds renewed so we know what God wants from us but not to know His sovereign will so we can predict the future. Renewing our minds requires reading the Bible and learning how to live and do every good work . For things not taught in the Bible renewing our minds requires praying and asking God to enlighten us so we can infer from the Bibles teachings on such things.

Happiness depends on whom we hang out with or belong to. Do not hang out with the wicked and mockers lest they own or control us . They will not give us happiness. Constantly think about and delight in the messages of the Bible. Think about how Christ became a man and died for us so we could be reconciled to God . Then like a tree planted by streams of water we will yield seasonal fruits and our leaves will never wither . Seasonal implies there will be periods of cold and desolate winters. Bad things will happen. Evils exist. We will experience seasons of pain suffering and grief. But even in deep distress we can still rejoice because we are Gods children forever. God constantly upholds us. So whether our life is easy or full of suffering God should be our center. Happiness is always a byproduct of something else. Dont seek it. If we focus on a happy marriage we will not get it. Christ taught us not to worry. First seek what is important to Him and live as He wants us to. Then we will have happiness . In conclusion bad people cannot bring us happiness. Instead center on God. Constantly meditate on the messages in the Bible. Then we will yield fruits in season and our leaves will not wither.",

We exist for a very short time. Then we die and rot. Why does it matter whether one goes down hugging or mugging kind or cruel? Does anything we do matter? Why even try to do anything? In Greek mythology Sisyphus is cursed to an eternity of rolling a large boulder up a hill only for it to roll back down. Some characterize hell as doing a pointless act again and again forever. Some believe in no god no way to know god no heaven and no hell. Some also believe that there is no basis for wrong and right. If one assumes everything ending in nothing then just following ones own desire also does not give life any meaning. Some say that love hate and every emotion in us are just chemical reactions. But something inside tells us a human is different from a rock. Something inside tells us there is evil and good. Popcorn machines should not make turkey. A sailboat should not run down main street. If we want to live a full and satisfying life we must know ourselves learn our reason to exist and follow it. According to Christianity a designer designed and built the world. The designer came as a human being and lived among us showing us His glory grace and truth. The designer loves us to the point of laying down His life for us . Our meaning in life is found in Christ the designer of life. Know and love Christ. If we do so we will have life and have it to the full .",

Mother Teresa is a hero we could learn from but the outpouring of grief towards Diana far eclipsed that for Teresa. Some attributed this to peoples shallowness but others found Diana to be more relatable and vulnerable. Some worship heroes and others distrust them. Lets learn from Samson a hero in . Israel was at a dangerous time. Philistines were assimilating them and many Israelites liked to be ruled by them. God used Samson to create a conflict with the Philistines. Samson killed a number of Philistines doing to them what they did to him. Three thousand Jews went to confront him because they didnt want Samson to disrupt their peace. Samson made them agree not to kill him but to hand him to the Philistines. Then using the jawbone of an ass he killed a thousand Philistines and made a joke out of it . Through one man God saved Israel from losing their faith and culture. Samson led Israel for years as a judgenot judicially but as a herowarrior. As a Nazarene Samson couldnt cut his hair. When pressed by Delilah he let her do it. Samson thought his strength guaranteed his success but he didnt know the Lord had left him . Then the Philistines seized Samson gouged out his eyes and humiliated him. Later Samson trusted in Gods sovereignty again. With his death Samson killed more Philistines than in his lifetime because he wanted to get revenge on the Philistines for two eyes . One main purpose of Samsons life was to get even. In a similar way the Jews also rejected Christ and handed Him to the Romans. But unlike Samson Christ follows God the Father. Christ didnt leave heaps of dead bodies. Instead Christ forgave them and many later became His followers. Through His death Christ destroyed the power of sin and brought salvation. Learn from Christ. Dont trust your abilities but depend on what Christ has done for us.",

What could have caused it? First he had lost his community. Previously he was with a joyful religious crowd but now he was isolated in the mountains . It is easier to feel depressed if we dont have others support. Second bad things were happening to him leading people to ask him all day long where his God was .

Furthermore he kept preaching to himself. Three times he questioned himself why he was so miserable. Three times he told himself to put his hope in God . And three times he said he would praise God his Savior . If we are depressed for a long period we should take care of our health and find support from others.

This is like the king allowing us to use his signature to write checks and endorsing them. If Father refuses us He is refusing Christ! But Christs name must be used properly. Ask God not to grant our prayer if we ask for things Christ wont ask. Our requests will be granted if they are right and if we believe. Now we can ask because the Father loves us and listens to us.

We love God because He first loved us . Christ tells us to ask . Its never in vain to wait upon the Lord who delights to give great things to those who ask. So ask continually. Satan wants you to stop praying. Dont listen. Dont give up. Ask simply and sincerely. Also pray for others. When God wanted to destroy the Israelites He listened to Moses pleading for them.

The Holy Spirit can even put fire in Gods children pushing them not to rest till their yearning hearts are fulfilled. But there are times when Gods children are weak and crushed.

    "The Right Way to Pray": {
        "content": "Prayers can be powerful particularly a righteous persons earnest prayer . Lets understand some attributes of prayers. Prayers are not for informing God what we or other people need. God knows what we need even before we ask . Prayers are not primarily for making requests. Parents do not like their children to talk to them only when they have needs. Prayers should not be artificial and theyre not for impressing or influencing others . Prayers are to God. Prayers should not be meaningless repetitions to fill time . We should be conscious of what we say. Prayers can be long if we are alert and genuine. Typically a long prayer starts with a burden. In prayers we must communicate sincerely and open our hearts to Him. God wants to have fellowship with us and wants us to speak freely and intimately to Him like children talking to their warm and loving father. Pray alone often. Christ often withdrew to the wilderness to pray alone sometimes praying all night . Asking for things in our prayer is fine particularly valuable things such as the forgiveness of sins . Though God knows what we need before we ask God wants us to express our needs and experience the joy of Him filling it. In asking we should be persistent. We can even ask with shameless audacity. . We should learn from the Lords prayer. It is not selfcentered. It uses the word our but not words like my I or me. The Lords prayer starts with Our Father in heaven. The Old Testament never addresses God as Father. We can because through Christs death and resurrection we can be Gods children . Addressing Him as our Father implies that He loves us and wants to help and bless us . The term in heaven implies at least power wisdom and glory. After all God is the Creator of heaven and earth. Know the significance of praying to our Heavenly Father. This is the foundation of our faith and the basis of our prayer.",

These should be earnest requests from our heart. The first and foremost request is that Gods name be honored and glorified. The primary focus is not on His kingdom or will clearly not on our health wealth or happiness. The second request is for Gods kingdom coming to earth. Evil is strong on earth. The ultimate solution is Christ coming back establishing His kingdom and bringing peace to earth. The third request is that His will be done on earth as in heaven. In heaven angels wait on God. Whatever God wants they will do immediately joyfully and completely. This request is that we our families and all countries do the same. The fourth request asks for bread our basic daily needs. It asks for bread not steak basic not luxurious. Also when I need food others need them too. In this request we ask God to give such to others not just ourselves. The fifth request asks for forgiveness of sins. Note that this request is after we ask for bread because we need food to live. Again this is for others not just for ourselves. Likewise Christ emphasized the importance of forgiving others for the Father to forgive us by immediately restating this point after the Lords prayer . The last request asks God to protect us from being tempted and from evil. God would help us endure all temptations but we should not purposefully put ourselves in the way of temptation. Then some versions of the Lords prayer acknowledge God owning all kingdom power and glory and end with Amen. We do not take power and glory for ourselves because all power and glory belong to God. Amen means we believe God will listen to our prayer. In",

We believe we are captains of our ships masters of our fateuntil catastrophe strikes. We tend to neglect prayer until we are desperate. But when we dont get the answers we want we think prayers dont work. Prayer is conversation with God not trying to exercise a force. Prayer should focus on May His will be done. It should ask God to let us know His will for us and give us the power to obey. When Jesus prayed He looked up towards heaven . He might have been sensing His Fathers power. But when we pray typically we face down. Are we focusing on our problems and our inadequacy? Instead of focusing on our weakness when we pray look up to Gods power His greatness and abundance. Look up to the throne of grace for us all. Because of Christ we can look up to the Almighty with confidence so that we may receive mercy and grace to help us anytime . We might have many problems facing us but we can ask God with confidence for what we needfor what we need today. With Gods help we can solve each problem if we face itone step at a time one moment at a time. Again in prayer ask God to reveal His will to you and ask God to give you the power to carry it out. Be still and quietly listen. Allow thoughts to come into your mind they may be from God. Take prayer breaks in the beginning of the day throughout the day and at the end of the day. Keep approaching the throne of grace . We are not that capable and life is unpredictable. But our redeemer lives . He is just a prayer away.",

    "How Should We Pray and Why?": {
        "content": "Christ tells us not to pray by keeping on babbling . Lets learn from the Lords Prayer on how to pray . The Lords Prayer starts with wishing Gods name be honored . This is important. For example God brought the dispersed Israelites back into Israel to demonstrate the holiness of His great name . Then the Prayer wishes Gods kingdom to come on earth and His will be done on earth as in heavenperfectly immediately and joyfully . The next verses ask God for our daily needs and for forgiving us as we forgive others. . This forgiveness is not on salvation because Christ was talking to the disciples. But it suggests not holding onto grudges which is important if we want to walk with others. The final verse asks God not to lead us into temptation but get us out from evil . It asks God to keep us from straying into bad situations because God doesnt tempt us. All the above are requests for God for very specific things. Other prayers in the Bible include asking for rain for wisdom sending workers to do Gods work removing some annoyance taking away certain pain or for someone else . We thank adore and praise God. But those arent prayers. Prayer is asking God for something specific something not selfcentered but for glorifying God . God is glorified by anything that reveals what God is like. How about prayer? How God responds to our prayer shows His love wisdom and glory. Through our prayer we know Him better . This leads to us worshipping Him. For example Abrahams servant asked God to help him find a wife for Isaac. When God answered his prayer the servant bowed down and worshiped God . To conclude pray to ask God for something specific something for glorifying Him. Through this process we will know Him better and worship Him so that He may be glorified.",

Some were eaten by lions in the Roman Coliseum as entertainment for the Romans. Some were nailed to death on crosses. But Paul never asked God to alleviate their difficulties and sufferings. Lets observe how Paul prayed for them in . In that passage the people Paul prayed for had two attributes . First their faith was in nothing but Christ. Second they loved all Gods people not just those similar to them or those they were attracted to. Though faith in Christ is primary practice is necessary. If we never forgive others or if we keep cheating them is our faith genuine? Faith in Christ should lead to a life that is more and more like Christ. Paul prayed that they would know three things . First was to know the hope coming from Christs calling to be the children of God. They were nobody when God called them . It was by pure grace that they could become Gods children which should have given them immense hope. Second was to know the wonderful blessings God had promised themthe rich and glorious blessings they inherited as children of the Almighty God. Third was to know Gods great power for them. It was the power that raised Christ from the dead and put Him far above all things and above all authorities at all times. Just imagine the magnitude of Gods power for His children! To gain such insights Paul asked God to give them the Spirit of wisdom and revelation so they might know Him better . Meditate on these verses. To conclude when we pray for suffering Christians we should ask the Holy Spirit to enlighten them to help them see the wonderful hope they have as Gods children the immense blessings He promised to give to them and His great power working for them.",

    "Was God Cruel in the Old Testament?": {
        "content": "Was God cruel and unreasonable in the Old Testament ? It depends on how you define right and wrong. According to Humanism a moral compass inside us defines right and wrong. In Confucianism heaven places this compass into us. This compass judges everything including whether God is cruel. If so this compass is above God. Note that the moral compass can differ depending on race and historical time. Another doctrine is that God determines right and wrong. God reveals His nature to us generally and specifically. Generally His nature is revealed by His creation . Specifically God reveals His nature through Christ and the Bible. Liberal theology accepts the parts of the Bible that can pass through their rationale. Catholics defer to their experts with the infallible Pope at the top. As for Evangelists what the Bible says is what God says. Evangelism accepts there are parts in the Bible we wont understand . Evangelism also accepts many Biblical descriptions as prophecies or precursors of things to come. Many passages in the OT predict and foreshadow Christs redeeming sacrifice such as Abraham sacrificing Isaac. Another set of precursors refers to the end times when God will establish a new heaven and earth . Technically speaking such biblical events arent historical because they arent repeatable on earth while historical events can happen again. Examples include Gods miracles and Christs resurrection. Other examples include certain catastrophic events in the OT that demonstrate Gods judgment in the end times. These parts of the Bible arent for teaching ethics for the current time but are about the world to come. In conclusion if we are the ultimate arbiters of right and wrong then we might consider some of Gods actions in the OT as cruel. But if God is the ultimate moral authority then we need to accept Gods total sovereignty in all thingsHe is the one who decides may His name be praised whether He gives or takes away .",

    "What are We to Make of Christ?": {
        "content": "Many see Christ as a moral teacher highly ethical full of wisdom with a brilliant and sane mind. But Christ can never be considered just a moral teacher. Some even consider Him a lunatic or a megalomaniac. See some of His offending remarks below Responding to the high priest He said He was the anointed one the Son of God . He forgave sins . How could anyone forgive a transgression not committed against them? He claimed to have kept sending prophets and wise men to the Israelites . He suspended Jewish rules telling people not to fast while He was around . He considered Himself sinless . He called Himself I am which is what God called Himself . Other religions claim to have the truth but Christ proclaimed I am the truth the way and the life . Trying to retain your life will ruin it. Giving yourself away for Him will save it . If we are ashamed of Him He will be ashamed of us when He comes again as God without disguise . He will set things right if we go to Him with our heavy loads . He is our food and our drink . He has overcome the world and we dont have to be afraid . Could His followers have created such remarks? Unlikely as they came from a nation convinced of only one God. Initially they were also reluctant to embrace Jesuss claims. Could Christ be a legend? According to literary historian CS Lewis too many descriptions in the story are clumsy not artistic enough and not properly explained to have been created as a legend. Hardly any ancient literature includes dialogue like the four gospels. Someone building a legend wouldnt allow this to happen. Also realistic novels only came about a hundred years ago. It is difficult to come up with an alternative explanation for Christ other than He was telling the truth God coming to earth to become a man died and resurrected. If Christ is what He said He is ignoring Him would be catastrophic. So choose wisely. A",

    "How Do We Know Christianity Is True?": {
        "content": "Our natural environment such as the stars cosmos and atoms witnesses God and His glory . But God is beyond us. Christ is the image of God full of grace and truth . He shows us our amazing God. He became a man humbly teaching serving and suffering till death for us. It is difficult not to believe Christ based on what He said and did. Many of Christs disciples died for Him. Given Christs life death and resurrection as depicted in the Gospel and corresponding evidence we can understand those disciples behavior. Their behaviors endorse Christ. The character of the New Testaments writers as illustrated in their writings is further endorsement of Christ such as John and Paul the latter of whom wrote letters in the NT. Their writings preclude us from considering them liars or lunatics as they demonstrate a character supporting the truthfulness of their writings. We assume that we and our work have some significance and we arent just talking nonsense. Such assumptions require accepting certain fundamental laws of logic causality and existence. These laws cant have any bearing of significance unless they are rooted in God. For example when you write poetry you dont want others to consider it like a dog barking. You want others to take you seriously and understand the messages you are trying to convey. Therefore you are assuming something important as the basis of what youre doing which is only possible with this Christian construction of God. But despite these logicbased arguments we can only see God and His glory if we are enlightened by Him . Based on our nature and ability we are blind to God and cant understand Him . When Christ raised Lazarus from the dead instead of seeing Gods power and glory the Pharisees plotted to kill Christ . Without a miracle without God shining into our hearts no one can see God and His glory in Christ . May God open our eyes and hearts to know and accept Christ.",

    "Violence and Killing in the Bible": {
        "content": "We deserve to die because of our sins. We live only because of Gods grace which He gives and can take away. How God takes life is His call and He can use humans as His instrument. For example when sin was rampant in Jericho God told Joshua to kill everyone there. Today God gives our governmentsnot citizensthe authority to kill . So why is there so much killing in the Old Testament and the New Testament ? The OT focuses on Gods righteousness and holiness. Killings in the OT are Gods just wrath against sin. The NT focuses on Gods mercy in the form of Christ coming to save the world . When Jesus cited He did not include its ending the day of vengeance of our God . Now is the time of mercy when sinners are welcomed to repentance. But this period wont last forever. One day the window of mercy will end. The NT closes with Revelation which depicts lots of horrific killing. Violence in the Bible also reflects the world we are in. Some of us live in a soft easily offended and emotionally fragile culture. But our history is full of violence and cruelty. When humans betrayed God God cursed our bodies and other physical creations . Moral evil is displayed in physical decay including flood famine pandemic and war. We have caused lots of violence and suffering. Such violence in the world reveals our need for civil authority. The phrase No kings in Israel is repeated four times in Judges preceding periods of violence when everyone did as they saw fit with no restrain . So lets not romanticize our goodness and believe we dont need police armies and laws in our society. Finally violence in the Bible shows the love of God. Observe the atrocity of Christs crucifixion. Such violence was in Gods original plan and is praised in Revelation . Our salvation is through the shedding of Christs blood. Because the violence He endured we can be reunited to God.",

    "Christian Apologetics": {
        "content": "Apologetics is the study of defending fundamental Christian doctrines. Science changes based on contemporary thoughts but Christian fundamental doctrines are timeless . Politics examines what means are effective and if preachers explain politics they must state them as personal judgment not from Christ . Many trivialize things because they happened thousands of years ago. But remember that your lifetime is just a tiny sliver of a long everexpanding history and shouldnt solely inform your perspective. Many distrust ancient texts. But the science of textual criticism authenticates their accuracy. Many dont take responsibility of their mistakes always blaming others and even God. Help them see they are ordinary people capable of greed envy unfairness and conceit. Learn the language of our audience. Paraphrase Christian terms such as atonement and church with more accessible vernacular. If you cant translate these ideas into simple words you dont really understand them. The Bible teaches what God had done for humans but it doesnt cover everything such as what God has accomplished for other parts of our universe. Earth is insignificant in the universe. Maybe God sought after earth because it had strayed not because it is special . It is difficult to argue the existence of God. Some suggest Christ was a great moral teacher deified by His followers. But this is not probable because His followers were Jews who vehemently believed there was only one God. The Gospels cannot be legends because many descriptions seem clumsy and were not properly explained. Also the genre of realistic fictions didnt exist before the th century. Dont water down Christianity and ignore the supernatural. Focus on Christianity being true not being good or moral. If false it is of no importance but if true is of infinite importance. Salvation is through Christ but we cant conclude that Christ cant save those who have not accepted Him in their lifetime. We cant say all other religions are false. But Christianity has perfected whatever is true in all other religions. In Christianity a savage is taught to obey enlightened universal ethics while the welleducated is taught to fast to a mystery and drink the blood of the Lord. Christian apologists must fall back to Christ not to their own arguments.",

    "Answers to Some Questions on Christianity": {
        "content": ". What happens to infants who die? They are saved. All people should know God and glorify Him as God. We are without excuse not to do so because we have access to lots of things God made and see the power of Him. Instead of glorifying Him many suppress what they know and the truth by their wickedness. They worship and serve created things rather than the Creator resulting in their condemnation. In other words we are accountable based on whether we have access to the necessary knowledge. If one doesnt have access one shouldnt be held accountable. Since babies and those with profound mental disabilities dont have access to the necessary knowledge they should not be condemned. Therefore somehow and in some way we dont understand they are saved. God through Christ covers these people as God honors this principle of accountability. . What are the Christian view of suffering? Rich in and implies abundance in wealth health popularity etc. Such people tend to feel contented without God making them hard to enter Gods kingdom. The rich live in a false happiness which God in His mercy may take away to bring them to eternal happiness. . Is it our works or Gods grace that earns our salvation? It is God who works in you and brings salvation to you. Yet we need to continue to work out our salvation with fear and trembling . . Is ambition good? Ambition for personal success is bad if the goal is to be better than others. But ambition is good if the goal is to do something well. . What about science? Christianity encourages scientific inquiry and knowledge and all that helps humans. However scientific knowledge is bad if it becomes the only thing that is of concern to you. . Does Christianity make you happy? Worshipping yourself can give you happiness. A bottle of wine can give you more happiness than Christianity for a short duration of time. . Benefits of going to church? Going to church can let you see others goodness and get you out of your solitary conceit.",

This God is the Holy Trinity the Creator of our time and space. Out of nothing God created the universe. As described in the Big Bang a smallerthanaproton component exploded expanding trillions and trillions of times and gradually cooled into matter all as hot gases. Then stars were formed. Some stars exploded and generated stardust the basic elements of life. Around one of the stars earth was formed. With the right amount of light and heat from the sun earth gave birth to all kinds of plants and creatures. Based on Gods divine plan one unique creature appeared. They were humans with consciousness. God breathed into this creature and they knew God. They could love and worship God and they knew themselves. God considered this creature to be His image on earth to rule over and take care of the earth. God saw all that He had made and it was very good . Over time humans grew accumulating knowledge and understanding. Unfortunately this magnificent creature rebelled and wanted more. They envied and mistrusted their Creator leading to alienation and destruction of all kinds. But the Creator loved them and would not let go. He wanted to be their God and dwell among them. God chose Abraham and his descendants to be light among nations. But sins continued to spread. To bring salvation to them God the Son Christ came on earth. Through Christ humans can be restored from decay and back into their true identity as children of God and as image bearers of God . Through Christ one day Gods creation will be restored things made new with humans shining in their full and true humanity.

    "Does God Exist? How about Evolution?": {
        "content": "Is Christian faith irrational? No. Otherwise how can we love God with our whole mind? . Lets look at a few common questions. Is the concept of an intelligent designer with power beyond nature reasonable? Yes because Look at our universe. About billion years ago a force started our universe together with space and time. Satisfying simple mathematical laws this universe has precise physical constants such as the speed of light and the gravitational constant. Change them even so slightly and the universe would not exist. Something so amazing and precise cannot come from nothing. Humans are born with a sense of right and wrong . Such laws exist throughout all civilizations though details depend on the society. Some explain the moral laws and altruism are for our existence. For example we want our family our genes to continue. If so we should be hostile towards outsiders but altruistic people take care of those totally different from them such as Mother Teresa. Such moral laws must come from somewhere. Christians believe they come from our Creator. How about evolution? Gods creation could include evolution. Many creatures genomes provide compelling evidence of their shared ancestry. Complex designs were formed through gradual changes over time driven by natural selection. Perhaps after evolution had prepared humans with sufficient neurological brains God gifted humanity with a soul and the ability to choose making humans in His image. Unfortunately we choose to disobey God and violate the moral laws estranging ourselves from Him. For Christians Jesus is the solution to our rebellion. Do Genesis chapters and contradict evolution? Regarding the first two chapters we need to consider the authors intent and the audience. Maybe they should be read as mystical or poetic documents but not as scientific documents. Just reading them literally one finds two different creation stories in the two chapters. In plants came much earlier before humans. But in humans came before plants and farmed the soil for plants to grow. Since even on their face there are contradictions we may not want to use science to explain them.",

For example regarding both the creation of the universe and the salvation Father designed Son realized and Holy Spirit supports. . The Trinity demonstrates the importance of fellowship. Does God predestine and know everything? Do we have free will? If God has predestined everything He should have predestined us good and not have to suffer through crucifixion. Instead our outcome depends on our choices . If God knows everything why did He pick Job to be His witness before Satan? Remember Job missed the mark. But God knew we would fail and planned for His sacrifice to save us. If God knows our needs should we still pray and ask? Yes because through our asking and His response God can build a more intimate relationship with us . However we should couple asking with giving thanks. Out of our human nature we ask. Out of us being Gods beloved children we give thanks because we know even if we do not get what we ask God has better things prepared for us. . Did Christ make mistakes as a baby or when He was tempted? No. He was born led and protected by the Holy Spirit. The Father and Holy Spirit were with Him. Also Christ loves following Gods wishes . We can be more like Christ by loving and following God and being protected by Holy Spirit. The Holy Spirit is explained in John and Romans . Through Christ the Father sent us the Holy Spirit who teaches comforts and helps us such as conquering the flesh . Because of Christ our flesh cannot control us anymore . When tempted by our flesh we can experience the power of the Holy Spirit . If we still let the flesh control us we will be enemies of God and die in sin . But if we follow and set our minds on the Holy Spirit we will live in Christ.",

    "Is God Anti-Sex?": {
        "content": "During the time of the New Testament Corinth was a place of high culture and fast living. Whatever one did was no one elses business. This led to rampant and unfettered sexual immorality . To them food was for the stomach and the stomach was for food. Both were temporary similar to body and sex. Another idea was that body and spirit were separate and unaffected by each other. This led to some people only focusing on the mind while others focused only on the body. Paul disagreed with such beliefs and behavior. He considered our spirit tightly integrated with our body one significantly influencing the other . To him the body was not meant for sexual immorality . Our current culture idolizes sex. In Atlantic reported that more than % of Billboard top songs had messages on sex. Some people are even considered inferior if not actively involved in sex with being celibate or single as boring broken and abnormal. But our culture also despises and stigmatizes sex. Some consider the media evil for promoting casual and consequencefree sex. Others blame pornography for causing distorted views on sex and leading to women being sexually assaulted. What should be our attitude towards sex? For Christians the key is not sex. The key is our identity. We are valuable to God. God sacrificed Himself to wash away our iniquities and to make us holy. Such wonderful gifts were bought at a very high price . Understanding our value is paramount. Sex should not be idolized or stigmatized. It is Gods design and therefore good. It is a gift for marriage. Having said that being single is wonderful also . In the years after Christ singles sat before the married in church gatherings illustrating the importance of the singles. Both being married and staying single can be blessed. The key is our identity in Christ. Having been bought at a hefty price we arent our own anymore. We should live a life to glorify God and honor Him with our bodies. Gods ways and designs far exceed ours. Follow Christ and we will flourish.",

    "Why Does God Allow So Much Suffering?": {
        "content": "Suffering is pervasive. As history progresses we experience different forms of suffering. For example in Medieval days half of all children died before age . Now with advances in technology education and lifestyle our suffering is more often mental rather than physical. To illustrate our anxiety towards suffering may have intensified. Sometimes we bring suffering onto ourselves with careless decisionmaking but often our suffering can seem senselessthe loss of a loved one natural disasters. The tsunami comparable to the power of M Hiroshima atomic bomb killed nearly people. Why do these things happen? If God is good and allpowerful why doesnt He prevent them? The Bible is filled with writers protesting to God on sufferings particularly what they considered the sufferings unjustified. Yet the Bible doesnt explain why there is suffering other than the world is broken and cursed. How do we cope with it? First know that our God understands suffering due to His personal experience. Christ went through the ultimate unjustified suffering tortured nailed on the cross left totally alone and even forsaken by His Father. The resurrected body still carried the scars of the nails revealing a wounded God. Second know that God suffers with us. Christ wept when His friends suffered . His love is always with us. Christians never suffer alone and are encouraged to seek comfort in friendship with one another. Third know that there is hope. Christ shows the ultimate hope at His resurrection. One day He will wipe all tears. Paul described his suffering on earth as light and momentary because eternal glory far outweighed his temporary pain . Finally think beyond yourself. Help the least and suffer with those who suffer. Then we share Christs suffering and will share His glory . Though the Bible does not explain why there is suffering we know our God understands suffering and He suffers with us. One day Christ will heal all wounds. We must learn to help others even in the midst of our own suffering.",

    "Is Christianity Intolerant to Other Faith?": {
        "content": "Having passion for what is good can be a virtue. Some attribute the Christian zeal to always considering themselves being right and even to the violent crusade. Is that true? Are zealous Christians intolerant of other faiths? Numbers describes a period of time when many Israelites were unfaithful to their wives and slept with Canaanite women leading them to idolatry and Israels eventual decay. To address Gods anger Moses demanded death to the Israelites who were ardent followers of the Canaanite gods . While Moses and the people were weeping an Israelite took a Canaanite woman into his tent in full view of Moses. At once the priest Phinehas went in and speared them to death. God commended Phinehas twice for being zealous for His honor . The word zealous took on a life of its own. Around BC Maccabees defeated the Syrians freeing the Israelites. Hanukkah commemorates this event and Maccabees was praised for his zeal. As God reveals more of Himself to us we advance in our understanding of Him. He reveals Himself to us through the life of Christ. When Christ was crucified He didnt spear His persecutors. Instead He took a spear from them. Christ shows that zeal for God leads to loving and suffering for our enemies even to the point of death so as to help them. We should follow Christ. The term zealots was used to describe a group of Jews fighting the Romans. One of them was Saul who zealously persecuted the Christians . After his transformation by Christ Paul realized he previously didnt know God . Paul described the danger of zeal without true knowledge . Such zeal could lead to severe cruelty in the name of God. Remember Christs most vivid condemnations were against the religious leaders at that time. We should ground our zeal on solid and true knowledge. Then our zeal will bless and not curse those who persecute us . So we should listen to learn from and share with those of a different faith. Dont just tolerate but respect and honor them so that Muslims Buddhists Jews and Christians may come to know Christ.",

He created male and female in His image both getting the same blessing and calling to steward His creation . After the fall God proclaimed that the husband rule over his wife . Like death this is a curse. This is part of the suffering Christ came to save us from. If so then how about Man being made first? If order determines significance then farm animals should be above humans. Eve as a helper suitable for Adam? The Bible also refers God as our helper . Woman covering her head? Paul might have suggested this as a way against sexual promiscuity when temple prostitutes in those days always exposed their heads. Also didnt Jewish men wear prayer shawl over their heads when praying? Woman having long hair while man short? That was the culture. Didnt Samson also wear long hair as a sign of obeying God? The head of a woman being a man? Such concepts reflected the social norm. Cultural changes take a long time. Learn from Christ. During those days woman took care of things while man focused on learning. But Christ commended Mary for sitting at His feet learning instead of preparing the house for Him like Martha . In Christs time a womans highest calling was childbirth and nursing. But Christ defined woman by the life she lived by hearing and obeying Gods words not by her husband or her child . Similarly Paul commanded the husband to yield his body to his wife as the wife yields her body to her husband . He endorsed women teaching or delivering messages to the congregation . Paul also taught both sexes to submit to each other . Therefore husbands and wives should love respect encourage challenge serve befriend and cherish one another regardless of gender.",

The verse You will know the truth and the truth will set you free is probably on more US university walls than any other statement. Christianity encourages reasoning. Paul a man of faith reasoned day after day in Athens marketplace with the Epicurean and Stoic . Our lifes foundation should pass through logic and reason. This will help us love God with our whole being which includes our logical mind. Christians dont blindly follow authority. For nearly three centuries after Christ Christianity grew under the hostile Roman Empire. Some believe there is no way to know the truth and treat morality as a matter of opinions traditions or preferences. On the contrary God gives us enough to know Him and lead a godly life . To gain knowledge some totally depend on science. We rely on science and its method of measurable data to understand the natural world. But science cannot tell us why the universe came into being the meaning of our existence whether hope is more valid than despair or whether people have equal worth. We need to have certain amount of knowledge and evidence of God in our personal experience. This will help us understand the visible and the invisible. Then follow what we have found wherever it leads. Having said that acknowledge we cant fully understand God and know that God will meet us in our doubts about Him. For example Christ cured a child though his father asked Christ to help him overcome his unbelief . Christ told doubting Thomas to put his finger into His nail wounds and his hand into His spear wound . Furthermore beware that knowledge can make us arrogant . Sometimes love can be more effective than winning arguments. If we have knowledge but not love we are nothing .

    "Sermon on the Mount: Law and Grace": {

This requires giving away all of our wealth not using the word fool inviting a bully to bully us again loving God with all our hearts and loving others including our enemies as ourselves . Did Jesus expect us to give to every panhandler crossing our path abandon all consumer rights and cancel our insurance policies? Lets learn from Russian novelists Tolstoy and Dostoevsky. Tolstoy deeply respected Gods standards and earnestly tried to live up to them. For example he freed his serfs gave away his copyrights and disposed of his estate. Yet he saw himself inadequate and was deeply unhappy. He died like a vagrant in a rural railroad station. Dostoevskys novels communicate grace and forgiveness. He accepted he was ultimately unable to follow Gods standards. His solution was love. To him we could love only if we are loved and we love because God first loved us . Examples of Gods forgiveness and love include Christ forgiving an adulteress a criminal on the cross and those who nailed Him selecting Peter to found His church recruiting Paul to be His chief gentile evangelist and blessing the poor in spirit the mourners and the meek. Tolstoy looked at the kingdom of God within him and saw his failure. He taught us to never feel comfortable in view of Gods standards. Dostoevsky looked at Christ within him and saw grace. He taught us to always be comforted by Gods forgiving love . The Sermon on the Mount tells us what God is like perfect compassionate even to those against Him and generously loving . The Sermon on the Mount also tells us that the Pharisees legalism isnt good enough .

God doesnt need our services in fact He provides all things and Christ came to serve . Our service should bear witness to His kingdom and bring glory to Him not showing off our abilities .

    "Self-Defense and Retaliation": {
        "content": "The Ten Commandments primarily focus on behaviors while the Sermon on the Mount focusses on desires. According to the Sermon our goodness needs to be better than that of the teachers of the law and Pharisees. They depended on their works but actions can be deceiving. Do we refrain from committing crimes for moral reasons or because we fear getting caught? Christ focuses on our hearts and desires. Actions arise from them. For example envy compelled Cain killed Abel committing the first murder in the Bible. Hate can lead to murder so dont even call someone a brainless idiot or a worthless fool . Lustful thoughts can lead to adultery so we should guard our minds . An eye for an eye should be the job of the government. Police and the court of law are established by God to administer justice matching punishments to the offense so as to deter criminals and purge evil . Sometimes force is necessary. For example Christ administered justice with physical force in a temple . In time of danger Christ told his disciples to get swords to defend themselves . Paul exercised his rights as a Roman citizen . But beware of the consequences. If one lives by the sword he will die by the sword . There are times to take the unreasonable hit turn the other cheek and go the extra mile. Note that insults are difficult to bear. Even Paul could flare up . But our endurance can turn enemies into friends or better yet into followers of Christ. Christ is our model. He loved His enemies as shown by His crucifixion. Christs behavior even converted the hardcore criminal who was crucified next to Him . Christ focuses on our hearts. He wants us to be perfect like our heavenly Father.

        "content": "Lets learn from Matthew Chapter . The Ten Commandments provide a list of do and donts. But the Beatitudes focus on the person we should become to be blessed and prosperous . True blessing is not from wealth power or obeying the Law. True blessing is based on who we are such as being meek hungry for righteousness merciful pure in heart and peacemaking. As we become blessed Christ told us we will impact the lives of othersbringing out the good in others preserving the good and introducing light to those in darkness so that others may see our good deeds and glorify our Father in heaven . Then Christ emphasized He came to bring the Law to its fullness . The endgame is not obeying the Law but to become like God. Christ explained with a few examples. He started with murder and adultery. Christ intensified the Law by considering having evil thoughts to be the same as committing the corresponding acts. The key is not just obeying externally but becoming like our heavenly Father . Another example is an eye for an eye. Previously the law included appropriate compensation. If a Jew had ruined a carpenters eyes he had to support his family because the carpenter could not earn a living anymore. But Christ told us to turn the other cheek if one cheek was hit and go two miles if demanded to go for one mile. We not only dont ask for compensation but also give to our evil enemies more than they asked . The last example is to love our enemies . Perhaps nothing better demonstrates Christs character than this. He healed the wound of the soldier who came to arrest Him. On the cross suffering beyond comprehension He forgave those who caused His intense pain. As we sin He keeps forgiving embracing and helping us on our path of discipleship. Such perfection is impossible without our Saviors grace. It is a journey to gradually become like our heavenly Father . Matthew gives us a glimpse into eternity. As of now we must keep trying to be a light to those around us serve lift them up and love them. Through Christs perfection we become complete.",

        "content": "Many listening to Christs Sermon on the Mount had dire physical and mental needs. Surprisingly Christ told them they could be blessed . Typically those considered to be blessed are the talented rich powerful healthy beautiful wellbuilt or crafty. Advertisements constantly depict the weak poor old sad awkward fat bald or ugly as the unfortunate. However according to Christ those with desperate spiritual needs those who consider themselves insignificant are blessed. The humble the gentle and those who grieve are blessed . Typically we do not consider such people to be living the dream life. According to Christ the determining factors of a blessed life are not based on what one owns how one looks where one lives or how much one knows. There is no need to be the slave of the worlds demand. Because of Christ we can be blessed. By depending on the grace of God even the worst of us can be secure in the kingdom of God. The deplorable and the misfits all can be blessed if they are in Gods kingdom. Not only did Christ see people differently He was a friend of sinners . He took them in as who they were. Alcoholics Anonymous success is at least because everyone there fully embraces each other as addicts. There is no pretending. Do not pretend there is no sin assuming everyone is perfect and happy. Instead accept everyone to be sinners to be inadequate . Though we are a train wreck God still accepts us as His children through Christ. This is the context of the Sermon on the Mount. May we see others differently than the world . May we see others as God sees us. May we accept others because God has accepted us.",

    "New Attitudes in Life": {
        "content": "In the Sermon on the Mount Christ told His disciples not to pursue eye for eye but to love their enemies . Christ used four examples to illustrate how not to repay anyone eye for eye or evil for evil . Not taking revenge does not mean being weak or encouraging injustice. Christ did not retaliate as He was nailed on the cross. Yet He challenged the high priest. Furthermore these behaviors are not for all relationships. For example judges are entrusted to punish the wrong and reward the good . Similarly the relationship of parents and children compared to that of employers and employees operate differently. In the Sermon on the Mount the behaviors focus more on personal interactions where one should let the state punish. Ultimately let God avenge and punish the one who is evil. God said It is mine to avenge I will repay . Christ also taught His disciples to love their enemies . In deeds they should seek good for their enemies . In words they should bless those who curse them . In prayers they should pray for those who persecute them . Otherwise they would be no different from the wicked who are good to those who are good to them also. Christ wanted His disciples to imitate their heavenly Father who loved them while they were His enemies . Also God gives sun and rain to the evil and the good . The Israelites were taught to love their neighbors and hate their enemies. But Christ wanted His disciples to be perfect not to take revenge or repay evil for evil but to overcome evil with good. This is impossible without the grace of God. However it helps to know we are blessed children of God and to know we are no better than our enemies who have needs and desires like ours. Humans cannot achieve perfection in this life but we can keep trying and asking God for forgiveness just as Christ taught His disciples to pray . Be merciful just as our heavenly Father is merciful .",

Then one day with large crowds following Him He went up on a mountainside and preached the Sermon on the Mount . Christ announced Gods kingdom before He began teaching the Sermon. Gods kingdom is a major theme in the New Testament He sent His disciples to proclaim the kingdom of God He taught them to seek Gods kingdom first and in the very last verse in Acts Paul proclaimed the kingdom of God . What is one major characteristic of Gods kingdom? The word kingdom typically refers to a place where a king rules and where his word is law. In Gods kingdom things happen according to His will. The citizens of Gods kingdom follow Him . The Sermon on the Mount describes some behaviors of those in the kingdom of God. We see examples of such behaviors in Christ on earth following the will of the Father. Where is the kingdom of God? In the Sermon on the Mount Christ did not teach us to pray that we go to heaven. Instead He taught us to pray for Gods kingdom to come down to earth such as Gods kingdom come Gods will be done on earth as it is in heaven . In the final glorious day Gods kingdom will be on earth and everything will be perfectly aligned to His will. But not now. Christ invited us to follow Him and heed His teachings in the Sermon on the Mount. Each time we do that or we get closer to doing that we will experience and show glimpses of the kingdom of God.",

Christ embraces our uniqueness with grace and truth . He unconditionally loves us not based on our merit or performance. He hung out with the drunkards and gluttons drawing them to Him . Yet He never compromised truth. God opposes any thoughts or actions that fall short of His will . He is against them because He cares for us. He sets boundaries because He knows going beyond will destroy our relationships and ultimately lead to death . Scripture which is inspired by God teaches us what is true and right . But sometimes our emphasis on certain mistake is disproportional to its representation in the bible. For example the Bible focuses significantly more on envy and greed than homosexuality though many concentrate more on homosexuality. Learn to use Scripture to assess ourselves not others. God tells us to run from sexual immorality which give us lots of guilt and shame. Sexual mistakes include pornography and sleeping with someone other than your wife. Christ didnt touch on LGBTQ issues though there was homosexuality in His time on earth. Use the entire Bible not one verse to see what the Bible affirms as good and correctsnot condemnswhat is wrong. The closest Christ taught on LGBTQ was marriage which He anchored on Gods original design . In marriage man and woman should be in a covenantal and committed relationship. One goal of marriage is to fill the earth with people to spread Gods goodness. Paul discussed the practice of homosexuality along with stealing greed drunkenness slander and swindle considering all as practices leading to hell . God knows all of us are broken and in need of a savior. We are called to trust Him to save us forgive our broken past and be purified . Trust that He knows best. Surrender to His will even when we dont understand. This will honor Him and exalt His name.",

Relationships should start from friendship to see if both sides can understand accept appreciate and work with each other preferably towards common goals. Then they move on to deeper friendship romance and commitment before going to sex. Fulfillment in sex comes from deep physical intimacy and full commitment from both sides. So sex and marriage should be tied. Masturbation focuses on just giving ourselves satisfaction. After reaching climax one can feel emptier and lonelier. Also masturbation depends on fantasy and is addictive. Dont let it control you. Dont try to know everything about the other person before committing. We are imperfect. Your relationship with your spouse depends on God and your intent to honor Him and to honor your commitment. Also God continues to work on us. So dont be too cautious. After we have spent some time with a person and we really like that person we should trust God and commit. What if we are constantly being rejected in dating? Try to identify the reasons. Ask your close friends for suggestions. Then move on and seek out other opportunities. Some want to remain single. That can be a good choice. Paul recommended being single and Christ was single on earth. Though God said it was good for Adam to have Eve happy marriage is difficult to have because we are imperfect. A spouse can reprogram your selfimage which could inflict damage on you. So dont be fixated on getting married or being single. Some idolize being single because they value independence. Others treat being single as a plague. Avoid both. For some being single comes easily. That is a gift. But for most it is better to be married.

Our culture puts too much emphasis on sexual immorality. describe a list of bad characters. They include the sexually immoral thieves drunkards slanderers and swindlers. Both greed and sexual immorality are on the list. If we define greed as an intense selfish desire for wealth power or food then both greed and sexual immorality focus on selfish needs. But our culture treats the sexually immoral much worse than the greedy. How do we control our appetites? Learn from those who diet. They bear hunger for something desirable such as health. Similarly we should abstain from frivolous sex for something desirable such as more fulfilling sex a happier spouse or a better relationship with God. For those who could not forgive themselves for their past sexual mistakes remember that we are imperfect. We constantly love something else more than God committing adultery against Him.

For Christians God created sex and considered it as good.

So Christians should flee from sexual immorality and sex outside marriage and instead give up their independence for intimacy with their spouse just as God voluntarily sacrificed His independence and became a vulnerable human to have intimacy with us. However being single without romance and sex is fine too . Traditional culture emphasizes family. In the olden days women were nobody if they were single. Nowadays many believe life on earth is everything so finding sex romance and ones true love are paramount. Christians hold different views. Whether married or single Christians shouldnt be too eager to change their status . Christians views on sex singleness and marriage are based on their hope in the ultimate family journey and love. Christians anchor their hope on the ultimate family of God not on their spouses or children. The world in the present form is passing away dont be too attached to it . Marriages among imperfect couples are a long and hard journey . Even if youve married the perfect person they will change. A Christians hope isnt confined by the worldly journey but instead rests on the ultimate journey of helping their spouse to become holy and blameless . Christians also hope for the ultimate love to be united with God . When the Samaritan woman asked Christ for living water Christ talked about her sex life . No man could satisfy her. Only Christ could. Christ is the ultimate lover we need. Whether we are single or married our hope should be in God. For those looking for a spouse find one with the same focus.

But Christ said I tell you that anyone who looks at a woman lustfully has already committed adultery with her in his heart . Yet the Bible rejoices in sex and sexual desire. Genesis depicts God creating sex through male and female. He called His creations very good. In before God naked Adam characterized naked Eve as bone of his bone and flesh of his flesh. The Song of Solomon celebrates sexual love for example with one admiring the others body when the other was going in for sex . Sex should unify two persons not just physically but emotionally mentally and spiritually. But sex without marriage means the parties only want to be united physically with each holding onto their own life. They are splitting their bodies from their souls. Sex should be an integrated act. It should reconfirm each party belonging completely and exclusively to the other. Thus sex should be limited to marriage. Lust is different from sexual desire. When a man lusts for a woman he wants her body only but not any other parts of her. He has dehumanized her. Lust is also an excessive desire. One can be totally driven by lust making it the center of ones life. It is like an idol. After getting the others body one still feels empty. There is no deep fulfillment in lust. The passage on lust also points to eyes and hands. Eyes refer to what one perceives and hands refer to actions. Have the right perception. Know that physical attraction is good but is just skin deep and cant be meaningful. Also take the right action. Run away from lustful environments. Sex in marriage is wonderful but it cannot replace God as the center of our life. Christ constantly refers Himself as the bridegroom who accepts and loves us His bride. Through faith we become absolutely beautiful in Christs eyes. Christ becomes the center of our life. Only He could give meaning to our life with deep fulfillment.",

If our boss loves something and considers it very good shouldnt we care for it also? Another reason we should care for our environment is because that was the original job God assigned humans to do. When God created man in His image God commanded him to rule over the creatures . The word rule in the original Hebrew means being a viceroy or a person representing the king when the king is away. So on behalf of God humans should take care of the creatures on earth which God also had expressed His concern for . Furthermore Gods creation is full of wonders. There are numerous passages in the Bible admiring them. One example is the six verses in Psalms where David was in awe of Gods physical creation including the heavens the skies and the sun.

At that point Christ had lost His sonship. He took on the curse we deserved so we could get Gods blessings .

But similar to a black hole ego cannot be satisfied. Paul had incredible ability but how was his ego? He did not care how others thought of him or how they judged him. These are attributes of a person with high selfesteem. But Paul also did not necessarily think well of himself. He did not consider himself innocent even if he had a clear conscience . This is distinct from many with high selfesteem who care a lot about how they think of themselves. Paul separated his performance from his identity. He did not think highly of himself despite his significant accomplishments. He considered himself the worst sinner yet he didnt beat himself up. His identity was entirely rooted in Christ. Because of what Christ had done God found Paul good and valuable . To Paul only Christs opinion of him counted . He also attributed his strength to Christ . Learn from Paul. How others see us and how we see ourselves are not that important. We should not define ourselves our identity or our value by our performance. We are blessed children of God because of Christ. Rejoice in Him. Rely on Christ to live.",

    "Do You Know an Arrogant SOB?": {
        "content": "Let's look at Haman the person the Persian king most honored . The exiled Jews seemed to do well in Persia . When the king of Persia required everyone to kneel and honor him and when Mordecai a Jew didnt comply Haman planned to use this as an opportunity to kill all the Jews in Persia. Previously Mordecai had warned the king of an assassination attempt. Having been reminded of Mordecais loyalty the king decided to reward him and asked Haman how to do so. Believing himself to be the recipient Haman suggested something extravagant and the king commanded Haman to personally deliver the reward to Mordecai. That gave Haman a lot of grief and began his downfall ultimately leading to his death. An arrogant person is only concerned with himself. Everything is about him. This person always considers himself to be right. Since he thinks he makes no mistakes he cant learn from his own failure or others criticism which leads to more serious blunders. This person tends to hold grudges. He assumes he would never commit the wrongs that others do and so he is less inclined to forgive. The humble will be exalted while the arrogant who always tries to lift himself higher will be humiliated . So how can we rid ourselves of arrogance particularly when it is so difficult for a person to recognize his own shortcomings? First we must admit that we tend to be selfcentered and arrogant. Remember that the conceited rarely think themselves as such. Second know that we are sinful and corrupted. There is nothing in us that we should be proud of. On the other hand we should not feel inferior and needy because through Christ we have Gods recognition and glory the glory Christ received from God the Father ! To conclude know that we are filled with defects yet because of Christ we have Gods glory and praises. Though we are confident and proud of our status there is nothing we should be arrogant about. So we should focus less on ourselves and more on others.",

Surrendering to God does not make us robots. Abraham Peter and Paul were not robots. God created us as joyful creative and intelligent people. We surrender at least because His will is much better than ours. Surrendering to God does not make us cowards. Instead by surrendering to God and trusting His sovereignty we do not depend on money appearance or others approval for our worth. Our peace does not depend on our external circumstances. Surrendering to God makes us stronger. May be due to our ego surrendering is challenging. Even Christ experienced difficulties. Though Christ considered doing the will of His Father as His food right before crucifixion Christ struggled to follow the path the Father had suggested for Him. Yet finally Christ prayed ot my will but yours be done. Then an angel came to strengthen Him. . . As addicts will tell us just trying harder by itself may not be able to alter deep habits. We probably have experienced the inner battle of not able to do what we should and doing what we should not. . Fortunately God can change us if we commit to change. God gave Zacchaeus the chief tax collector the power to become the poster boy for generosity. . God changed the timid Simon to the courageous Peter. God changed the killer of Christians Saul into the first evangelist for gentiles Paul. Just as Paul said I can do all this through him who gives me strength. Phil .

Also business needs money to support their employees and grow. So money is good. But according to the Bible the love of money is foolish and the root of evil. Tim. So is money good or bad? Lets learn from Timothy . First if the rich thinks they are superior not just financially smart then they are foolish and even nonteachable. If they further believe they are great because of the good work done through their wealth they are in a deep sinkhole. We are good only through Gods grace. So Paul commanded the rich not to be arrogant . Second as we move up the social bracket if we let luxuries become necessities and try to keep up with the Joneses we just want more. Then money becomes an addiction. Christ told us to be on guard against greed . It is easy to see if we have killed someone. But difficult to see greed. How to escape the trap of money? Be content in all situations . We came naked and we leave naked. Wealth accomplishments nothing we could take with us . Be content where we are. Yet some believe wealth could bring security. They try to cover up their helplessness and nakedness with wealth making them unwilling to part with it. But wealth cant give us security. Be aware that true wealth and security come from grace from us being Gods children. Our goodness is through Christs suffering an innocent sufferers suffering. He was stripped naked so we could be clothed and safe. Through Him death isnt an executioner but a gardener making us better through death. Through Christ we become Gods treasure valuable and secure. Lead a simple life. As we have more wealth though we could live more extravagantly still keep a simple life. Life does not consist in an abundance of possessions . To conclude nothing is wrong to be rich . Enjoying material life is fine. But dont love wealth and dont be arrogant because of it. Instead use money.

The gold image had no name symbolizing the kings gods representing his value in Babylons culture. In many pluralistic societiesours includedcitizens could keep their belief in private. But in public they are expected to worship the gods of the society assimilating to public culture by forcing everyone to privatize their faith. For example our business world is ruthless. To gold we bow. Havent Christians succumbed to the culture? Daniels three friends received Babylons education and worked in Babylons government. But when asked to privatize their faith they insisted God could and would protect them but even if God didnt they still wouldnt worship the gold image .

I grew up in Paris moved to New York got married and dreamed of getting rich. But God planted discontentment in us. We felt stuck and wanted more than just surviving and maintaining. In his book Experiencing God Henry Blackaby used surfing as an analogy of experiencing God. Instead of creating your own wave get into the water wait and watch to see what God is doing. When a wave comes swim over and ride on it. In my wife and I prayed for nine months asking God to make us love and experience Him more. A year later with three kids we moved to China. I spoke very little Chinese and didnt understand the culture. What is God asking you to do that feels uncomfortable? To grow we must trust God is in control take risks and step out of our comfort zone. Second seek to engage the lost . Luke describes three parables the lost sheep out there the lost coin inside the house and the lost sons one outside the other inside. There are just as many lost outside as there are around us. To engage requires confronting and speaking the truth in love . Tell your own stories to have transformation to take place. Third teach others to obey everything Christ has commanded you . Teaching helps us grow. Forget the title of pastor . Just perform its function. Have the heart of a shepherd to have impact on others. Walk the talk. Meditate on Gods words and show what it means to obey Him . And you will grow. Finally dont worry.

Examples include the disciples forming the first century church the founding fathers of democracy in the eighteenth century the generation who fought Naziled genocide the civil rights leaders who fought racism parents in every generation building up stable families and creators of technologies that liberated many. According to some studies we still have more than million people held illegally in slavery. Kids are forced to roll cigarettes fourteen hours a day and kids younger than ten are sold to pedophiles. We need people to raise their voices to identify the culprits. We need people to stand up using law enforcement and survivor services to stop such practices.

For example during the twelfth Century fighting in the Crusades probably was considered the work God wanted the people during that time to do. In the story about Martha and Mary Martha thought she did a lot of work for Christ. But Christ reminded her it was more important to quietly listen to Him .

But accomplishing great Christian work does not guarantee that were close to God. Look at the disciple Judas the prophet Balaam and the king Saul. An externally successful minister can be spiritually dry lacking Christian characters. A person can sound very spiritual but if he does not love he is only a resounding gong . Martha did many things for Christ but Christ reminded her not to worry too much and neglect His teachings .

Rest should start with worship reminding us who God is and who we are. By acknowledging God as Lord we can relax and rest. In rest we can enjoy Gods creation. We can spend time on something we ordinarily dont do. In rest we can let ourselves wander without planning every moment of our time. If we have to work continuously for a long time like doctors during internship we should schedule rest after that. Note that in rest we can miss opportunities. Treat it as leaving something on the table for others to have. We can form support group and rest with others like us. Through Christs death on the cross we become Gods children. In Gods eyes we are good. Learn to work and rest. Learn to enjoy the rest that God enjoyed after His creation.",

        "content": "For many of us work is allconsuming. Family members dont have time to eat together and friends dont have time to hang out. But work can fail. And for those who define themselves by their work this failure can be devastating. What is the Bibles instruction on worklife balance? First work is good. God worked to create the world . We are made in Gods image and likeness. So work is good for us also and God has prepared the good work we should do . Good work takes many forms. For example God planted a garden for the people He created . Christ on earth worked in construction. Parents toil to raise their children. These are different forms of work. We should choose work that fits us based on abilities God gives us but also work that addresses the needs around us. Then balance work with rest. Rest is essential. Even God rested after He worked to create the world . But we cant have true rest if our work is entirely for ourselves or we use work to define ourselves. In the movie Rocky Rocky Balboa says he worked very hard because he didnt want to be another bum from the neighborhood. Describing her drive the famous singer Madonna once said I still have to prove I'm somebody. It is difficult to rest with such goals. Christ gives us real rest . Our value is found in us being Gods children a grace from God through Christs death on the cross. Such acceptance will give us real rest. Work is good. We should do the good work God prepared for us work that fits us and addresses the needs around us. We also should balance work with rest. Believing in Christ will give us real rest.",

    "Why and How Should We Work to Improve Things on Earth?": {
        "content": "Should Christians passionately improve things on earth? Shouldnt we focus on our eternal life Christ coming back? Lets learn from . We as Christians shouldnt tie ourselves and our identity to our work on earth . We shouldnt be enslaved by worldly passions or addicted to things like money personal gain or selffulfillment. Instead we should look forward to our eternal life in a perfect world of justice and peace with no sufferings . Having said that Christians shouldnt ignore things on earth. We should be eager to do what is good bringing glimpses of our wonderful future to earth now . So live a selfcontrolled upright and godly life . Work to help human flourish. This includes helping the community and upholding public justice and public good. For example if we have the power dont withhold the good from those to whom it is due . But beware that we the broken live in a broken world. Life now isnt black and white but is gray. Our work cannot be perfect. Many idealists initially passionate to change the world become cynical after repeated failure. In Leaf by Niggle JRR Tolkien describes an artist trying to draw a great tree. Inundated by mundane chores and duties and the need to help others he only manages to draw a leaf before he dies. Then before him is the great tree for him to further improve upon. Earth is full of thorns and thistles. Dont be discouraged if you can only draw a leaf. Just do what you can. Have faith that someday you will see our great tree and improve on it . To conclude by grace and through Christs sacrifice we become Gods children with a glorious future. We should do good and work to bring glimpses of our wonderful future to earth. But we the flawed live in a defective world. Just do what we can. One day something even better than our dreams will come true. This is our blessed hope.",

    "Could Our Work Be Joyful?": {
        "content": "We shouldnt be idle or depend on others to take care of us . But many consider their work to be a drag. Can work be less grueling? What are some attributes that would make work more fulfilling? Our work shouldnt focus on our own fulfillment. Many work solely for their own fame or fortune. Selfcenteredness brings a lot of pain. Our work should not define us such as I am an engineer a painter a housemaid a housewife or a preacher. If we let our profession define our meaning of existence or our identity work will become our idol and burn us out. The movie Chariots of Fire contrasts the attitudes of two British runners in the Olympics. Harold Abrahams won the meter dash. He said when he ran he had lonely seconds to justify my existence. He also said Ive never known . Im forever in pursuit and I dont even know what I am chasing. Our status and our identity should not depend on how well we have done our work. Our identity is from being Gods wonderful children based on what Christ has done for us. God embraces us because of Christ not our work. The other runner Eric Liddell won the meter dash. He said I believe God made me for a purpose but he also made me fast. And when I run I feel His pleasure. Running didnt define him. After winning the Olympics he left England to be a missionary in China. Our work should utilize the gifts God has given us. But if God calls us to do something that doesnt seem to fit just do it. He will supply the necessary power. We should sincerely try our best. Work to appreciate what God has done for us . Work to honor God. Finally work to address needs around us serving and benefiting others . Work to bring human flourishing as an expression of love.",

    "Dignity in Work": {
        "content": "Can very lowlevel work be dignified? Why shouldnt bosses exploit employees to maximize profit? Why shouldnt employees do as little as possible? Lets learn from Pauls teachings for firstcentury slaves and masters. But first did Paul condone slavery? During Pauls time slaves were servants by contract. It was not based on race nor was it a permanent position. Slaves could own other slaves and properties. Many were war captives. In Paul focuses on how slaves and masters should behave in such a social structure not whether there should be such a structure. In fact following Pauls teaching would end the slave system. Early churches were filled with slaves who worked in humiliating and painful environments. Paul treated them with respect addressing them first. Paul told the slaves to obey and serve their masters wholeheartedly as if they were serving the Lord because the Lord would reward each one for the good they do. Then Paul said something totally against the norm. He told the masters to treat their slaves the same way. He also added that God wouldnt show favoritism to anyone. Before God masters and slaves are equal both made in His image saved by grace not works. Their status does not depend on their work but rather on being Gods children. Naturally each should treat the other with respect and serve each other God will reward them for the good they do. If bosses have such attitudes they will treat their workers well. And workers will not work only when their bosses are around. Such attitudes would end the slavery structure during Pauls time. Centuries later during the abolitionist movement Christians vigorously pushed for abolishing a different type of slavery. As to the workers themselves they are dignified no matter their rank. During the Reformation Martin Luther argued that different types of work can all be callings from God. Milkman housemaid lumberjack monk or priestall can enhance human flourishing. We are equal before God. Our status is based on being Gods children. Our value comes from God not our work. Both bosses and employees should respect and serve each other. God will reward the good work we do. All kinds of work can be dignified as all can help people flourish.",

    "The Excellence of Christ": {
        "content": "Lets understand some of Christs diverse characteristics. Christ obeys yet is equal to the Father. All things depend on Christ yet Christ is reliant on the Father . Christ has infinite glory majesty and absolute sovereignty He is worthy to have all the good yet He descended on earth to live humbly gently and calmly to serve the weak lowly and despicable to patiently endure terrible suffering and humiliation and to die on the cross . Christ was born in a manger to poor parents and submitted to them for years. He was born via the Holy Spirit with power over Satan as our Counselor Mighty God Everlasting Father and the bright Morning Star . Christ had no place to sleep with his livelihood supported by female followers yet He had power over nature walking on water calming the sea casting demons to pigs curing sickness and raising the dead with a voice from heaven proclaiming Him to be the beloved Son of the Father . Christ was treated as a criminal delivered to His enemies and forsaken by the Father and everyone yet He gained complete victory and was exalted in the highest with His name above all names and received praises and glory from millions of angels . At the last judgment our merciful Christ will appear as the bridegroom to the church inheriting the Kingdom with them forever. Yet earth and heaven will tremble before our just Christ . We should desire no other savior than Christ who gently and humbly knocks at our door waiting to invite us into the Fathers house uniting us with God to be our friend defending us to give us joy rest and water of life and to be exalted with us in His glory .",

    "How We Worship in Everyday Life": {
        "content": "Many Christians live a double life. Spiritually they enjoy Gods fellowship praying to Him and learning from the Bible. Secularly they enjoy worlds affairs like eating sleeping working and exercising. Some prefer such activities over the spiritual ones. Others consider such activities a waste of time. Many are caught in the middle finding no peace in either. We live in a natural world with its limitations and a spiritual world with its unknowns. But we do not have to live separate lives. On earth Christ had no divided life. Its entirety was pleasing to His Father . Paul did not do certain things for God and others for himself. He did everything for Gods glory including eating and drinking . Our bodies are not innately offensive to God. He created them and was not ashamed of His work. On earth Christ also took on a body. All we do can be sacred if we live according to Gods will as we understand it from the Bible. Our different acts become acts of worship totally accepted by God. Every act can glorify Him. Whatever our profession or our calling is it is not inferior to that of a pastor. Our motives behind our actions are often more important than the actions themselves. Having said that certain things we do are more important. Some people are more useful to the society because their Godgive talents differ. But God accepts with pleasure all of us and our different types of activities. Also dont associate certain places or certain times as more sacred. This is spiritual slavery. The key is to worship Him in the Spirit and in truth . All these may be difficult to accept as habits are difficult to change. Meditate and pray on them. Ask God to help you enjoy and even excel in your daily activities. Be a witness for Him in them and honor Him. Be as enthusiastic and dependent on Him about the activities as if you were spreading the Gospel in an Amazon jungle. To conclude our entire life can be good and holy and every simple task can be an act of worship.",

    "Why Giving Ourselves to God Isn't Stupid?": {
        "content": "Paul urges us to offer ourselves to God as a living sacrifice . What does it mean and why should we? The term living sacrifice seems to be an oxymoron. In the Old Testament once offered the sacrifice would be reduced to ashes. How could a sacrifice be living? Paul seems to suggest we can give ourselves as living beings totally to God. We dont belong to ourselves anymore. Instead we belong to God. Some live for their independence. They are the bosses of their own lives and no one can tell them what to do. Some live for their spouses children careers money fame or power. These things become their idols controlling them. They live for and sacrifice themselves to these false gods. But Paul urges us to live for God and sacrifice ourselves to Him. Why should we? First we should because of Gods love for us . Christ voluntarily laid down His life for us no one forced Him to do it . In Gethsemane Christ knew of His impending suffering yet He still followed through. Second God is infinitely wise. He knows what is best for us much more than we do. Thus we should follow His guidance. Sometimes shortterm outcomes dont make sense but we need to trust Him. In a certain way this is similar to drawing a flower using the right side of the brain. If we use this approach when we try to mimic the outlines of the flower some of the strokes may not make sense at the time of drawing. But if we just keep going all the strokes eventually will come together to reproduce the picture of the flower. If we follow Gods guidance He will be responsible for the outcome. We can rest in Him. In conclusion because of Gods love and His infinite wisdom we should live as if we belong to God. Follow Him let Him take charge and live for Him!",

    "Worship Gives Us Peace and Rest Even in Great Adversity": {
        "content": "Can worship give us peace and rest even in great adversity? Lets learn from Psalm . Psalm describes many attributes of God. He is the great King above all things. He is our God who created the mountains the sea and the land and who created us. He saved us and continues to care for us . In light of who He is Psalm describes different ways to worship Him. For example we adore Him with emotion by singing joyfully to Him in praise and thanksgiving. We adore Him with will by submitting to him bowing only to Him. And we adore Him with intellect by listening to Him and following Him . Worshipping the wrong thing is detrimental. We may think owning some earthly object will make our life perfect. In Harry Potters Mirror of Erised Erised is Desire spelled backwards. Deeply desiring an earthly object will make it an idol which can then control us and ultimately destroy us. Psalm ends with declaring that the Israelites who left Egypt will find no rest. Believing in God as who He is and believing that He accepts us because of Christ not due to who we are or what we do will give us true rest. Then we can find peace even in the midst of crisis. Note that Psalm always uses the word us not me. Worshipping in a group has benefits. For example the group helps each other see Gods different personalities. See the highest beauty power and love in God Himself. Then our hearts will exalt our great and loving God. We will thank Him and joyfully sing to Him. We will kneel bow and listen to Him so that the dangers and suffering of this world will cease to control us. The power of evil will dissipate. In great adversities we will still have peace joy and rest.",

    "Mark of Deep Spiritual Experience": {
        "content": "Many are intrigued by spiritual experiences. There are numerous books and websites on this subject. They could be on different forms of awakening Zen meditation or other methods. Why do these experiences fascinate us? For Christians the center of spiritual experience is God. But we cannot find God. Only God can reach out to us. Yet we seek Him because He has put such an urge in us. This desire is a blessing. To a certain extent this desire is evidence of His presence. What are some marks of deep spiritual experience? David was a man after Gods heart . Lets learn from him. David wrote Psalm when he was in a desert in a dry and parched land where there was no water . In Psalm David addresses God as my God not just God. This is one of emotional intimacy. In a dry barren land of intense heat David earnestly thirsted for God. His whole being longed for God . Typically we focus on our physical needs first but Davids hunger for God totally transcended his physical needs. After physical needs our concern usually shifts to security. Not David. He was hiding in the desert running away from his enemies. But David didnt ask God to protect him from his enemies. Davids hunger for God transcended his wish for survival. Why? David considered Gods love better than life. God would fully satisfy him like the best food. God alone was his help protecting and upholding him . Thus even in such dismal conditions David was not concerned about his own needs. He was not thinking about food water or his enemies. Instead he was even thinking of God in bed through the night. David was sure his enemies would be destroyed eaten up by jackals. His lips glorified God praising Him with songs as he rejoiced in Him. These are signs of deep spiritual experience.",

    "What Does the Benediction Mean?": {
        "content": "Sunday services regularly end with the benediction The Lord bless you and keep you the Lord make his face shine on you and be gracious to you the Lord turn his face toward you and give you peace . What does this mean? First he Lord bless you and keep you. In old Jewish tradition a father near the end of his life would bless his children by wishing them well and dividing up his property among them. Similarly if God blesses us God is delighted in us wishing us well and committing His power to help us get there. Next comes wishing for the Lords face to shine on us. Before His face can shine on us we need Him to turn His face toward us. God turning His face toward us implies God desires a personal relationship with us. After the Garden of Eden we lost that personal relationship with God. Thats why God told Moses that no one could look at His face and live. In order to have His face turn toward us and shine on us we need Gods grace. Where does this grace come from? In the days of the Old Testament the benediction came after offering sacrifice which provided redemption for sins. Now we receive Gods grace via Christs sacrifice. Now Gods face can turn toward us and shine on us and we even can have Gods glory . The Latin root of benediction is to speak well of denoting our wish to have God affirm us. As social beings we like to have someone of importance speak well of us. Gods blessing is the ultimate affirmation. Thats one reason the benediction ends with peace from God. If God speaks well of us we dont need to seek others approval. Only Gods affirmation will bring us peace. We have Gods blessing because we are welcomed into Gods almighty family as His children. This gives us Identity powerful support freedom from sin the security of a loving Father and intimacy with God. May we enjoy the benediction. May we share this benediction with others and build them up.",

    "The Importance of Hallowed Be Thy Name": {
        "content": "Typically we pray when we are in trouble. But the Lords Prayer starts with Hallowed by thy name instead of asking for our health life or happiness . Why? Hallowed be thy name can be interpreted as honoring Gods holy name or adoring Him. In the Lords Prayer honoring God comes before asking for our daily bread or lifes necessities . Typically our primary focus is on earthly things such as a job our children a girlfriend or a promotion. We should bring these concerns to God but not before honoring Him. And we should never be anxious about them . Honoring God also comes before asking for forgiveness . A man was unfaithful to his wife. Even after he had confessed to God and his wife had forgiven him he still could not forgive himself. This was because he came from a prudish family which treated sexual sin as an almost unforgivable offense. Such an upbringing suffocated him. If he had honored God as Lord rather than considering himself the true arbiter of forgiveness he should be able to forgive himself since even God had forgiven him. Honoring God enhances our relationship with Him. God told Adam and Eve not to eat the fruit from one particular tree. Then Satan deceived them into believing that God was keeping the best from them. They wouldnt have lost trust in God if they had focused on honoring Him. Why should we honor or adore God? Reasons can be found in the beginning of the Lords Prayer Our Father in heaven. Our Father implies that He loves us as a father loves his children. In heaven signifies His power and holiness. To cover our offenses Christ sacrificed for us. We honor God because He is loving powerful and holy. Such an attitude gives us the right perspective and priority in life and enhances our relationship with Him.",
